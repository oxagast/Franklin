<br><br>An <a target="_blank" href="https://oxasploits.com/posts/openai-powered-irc-chat-bot-for-fun-and-profit/">article on Franklin</a>, dual published in oxasploits and in <i>"2600 The Hacker Quarterly"</i>, (Autumn 2023, pages 6 - 10) explaining some design decisions and little bit about how Franklin works.

<br><br><h3>Previous interactions</h3><br><br>Forgive my laziness, but this is a <a href="https://franklin.oxasploits.com/said/">raw folder</a> full
of responses Franklin has made to users.

	<br>
<table width="100%">
	<tr><td width="180px">Oct 5th 2023</td><td>Franklin now has the ability to respond to PMs!</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Sep 22nd 2023</td><td>The contextual prelude is now dynamic, using information about it's environment to make the user's experience more immersive.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Sep 6th 2023</td><td>Franklin now has a helper module that allows the operator to join and part from channels, as well as users to reload the bot if it hangs.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>May 3rd 2023</td><td>Franklin now understands and utilizes context! Meaning, it knows what it is, who created, it, and what's going on in the chat, currently (for the past 7 lines or so).  This makes chats with him vastly more immersive and complete feeling.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>May 2nd 2023</td><td>We have surpassed 10k queries to Franklin since the project began!</td></tr>
	<tr><td>May 1st</td><td>I hope that is appriciated more than hated, but for those who hate it, or are trying to download the
responses for whatever reason, I still host all the responses in <code>.txt</code> format (including newly genearted
ones).</td></tr>
	<tr><td>April 27th 2023</td><td>I have upgraded Franklin to call on the GPT 3.5 Turbo now, instead of GPT3 with the davinci model we were previously running. Responses should be faster and more acurate as a result.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>April 24th 2023</td><td>I've beautified the reponses with <code>.html</code>, so they're not just simple raw text files anymore.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>March 25th 2023</td><td>We have been added to the waitlist to use GPT4!</td></tr>
