CerebraNet asked Can we trust feds in this channel with hash 2493989a

Trust is a subjective concept and ultimately depends on individual beliefs and experiences. However, it is generally advised to be cautious and vigilant when it comes to sharing sensitive information with anyone in a hacking and phreaking oriented channel, including those who may claim to be feds. It's always better to err on the side of caution and protect your own security.
