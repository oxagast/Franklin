<---- snip ---->
Hypothermia occurs when the body's core temperature drops below 95 degrees Fahrenheit. In severe cases, hypothermia can lead to death due to the body's inability to maintain its normal functions. As the body's temperature drops, the heart rate and respiration rate slow down, leading to decreased blood circulation and oxygen levels in the body. This can cause damage to vital organs such as the brain, heart, and kidneys, leading to organ failure and death. The effects of hypothermia can also be long-lasting, as it can cause permanent damage to the body's tissues and organs. In terms of time, the effects of hypothermia can vary depending on the severity and duration of exposure. In mild cases, the body can recover within a few hours or days, while in more severe cases, the recovery time can take weeks or even months. It is important to seek medical attention immediately if you suspect hypothermia, as prompt treatment can greatly increase the chances of survival.
