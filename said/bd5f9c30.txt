<---- snip ---->
Elysium can be used as a metaphor for the inequality of wealth in modern society by comparing the elite in Elysium (those who live in luxury and abundance) to the marginalized in modern society (those who suffer from poverty and lack of resources). The extreme disparity between the two groups serves to highlight the stark differences in wealth between the privileged and the underprivileged. This can be used to emphasize the unequal distribution of resources in modern society and how it affects the lives of those who are less fortunate.
