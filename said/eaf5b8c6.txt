<---- snip ---->
No, counting cards in blackjack is not a guaranteed way to make a profit in a casino. While it can increase your odds and give you an advantage, it is not foolproof and casinos have measures in place to prevent card counting. Additionally, it is illegal in many casinos and can result in being banned or even facing legal consequences. It is important to always follow the rules and laws when gambling.
