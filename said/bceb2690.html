<h2>Franklin</h2>
<br><i>Mon May  1 12:50:53 2023</i><br><br><br><b>dirmaster0</b> asked: <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Who was a better drug kingpin, Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo or Pablo Escobar? <br><br>This is a difficult question to answer because both men were successful in their respective drug operations and achieved notoriety for their criminal activities, but their methods and motivations were different. Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo was a Mexican drug lord who was the founder of the modern Mexican drug trade, and his influence and power extended throughout most of the country. He is known for having created a loose federation of drug cartels known as the Guadalajara Cartel in the 1980s. Pablo Escobar was a Colombian drug lord who was the leader of the Medellín Cartel. He was known for his violent methods, including the assassination of political figures, and his wealth and power were unparalleled. Ultimately, it is up to the individual to decide which drug kingpin was better.
