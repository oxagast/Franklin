<---- snip ---->
Critical thinking is important because it enables us to understand and evaluate concepts and ideas at a deeper level. Critical thinking allows us to analyze facts and evidence, consider different perspectives, weigh up options and make reasoned decisions. It helps us to recognize and challenge our own assumptions, biases and beliefs. Ultimately, critical thinking helps us to become better problem solvers and more effective communicators.
