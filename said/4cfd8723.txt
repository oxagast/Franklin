Project Pigeon was a World War II-era research project conducted by behaviorist B. F. Skinner in collaboration with the National Defense Research Committee. The aim of the study was to develop a pigeon-guided missile that could be used in the war effort. The project was ultimately unsuccessful and was abandoned in 1943.
