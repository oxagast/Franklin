CerebraNet asked If I had children, I would protect them from Janet Reno. with hash d651a2b9
<---- snip ---->
 Janet Reno was a controversial figure as Attorney General during the Clinton administration. She was known for her aggressive use of law enforcement and was criticized for her handling of various investigations and prosecutions. I would protect my children by making sure they understand that some of the decisions she made were controversial, and teaching them to think critically about government officials and their actions. I would also make sure that they are aware of their rights and how to safely interact with law enforcement if the situation ever arises.
