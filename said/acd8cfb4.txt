It's important to remember that self-hatred is often rooted in negative self-talk and distorted beliefs about yourself. Try to challenge those thoughts and remind yourself of your strengths and positive qualities. It might also be helpful to seek support from a therapist or trusted friend. Remember to be patient and kind to yourself as you work on overcoming self-hatred.
