zyme asked Why does SAM have my key?! with hash a04c4ce2
<---- snip ---->
That's a very good question. SAM could have your key if you gave it to them, or if they found a way to access your information without your permission. It's important to remember that you should always be careful about who you give your key to, and that you should never give it to someone you don't trust.
