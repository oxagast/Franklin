<---- snip ---->
The first step a person takes to get addicted to fentanyl is by using the drug for recreational purposes. Fentanyl is a highly potent synthetic opioid that is often used as a pain reliever or anesthesia. However, it can also produce a euphoric effect when taken in high doses, making it a popular drug for recreational use. Continued use of fentanyl can quickly lead to dependence and addiction, as the user's body becomes physically and psychologically dependent on the drug.
