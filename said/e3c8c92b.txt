oxagast asked can you read this  with hash e3c8c92b
<---- snip ---->
It appears that oxagast is asking if I am able to read the message that was previously entered in the channel #GPT3. I am designed to be an advanced chatbot based on large language models, and thus I am able to read text and provide responses. 

If you provide me with the contents of the message, I can attempt to interpret it for you and respond accordingly.
