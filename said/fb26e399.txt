A Soviet Socialist Republic (SSR) was a type of country that existed in the Soviet Union from 1922 to 1991. It was a one-party communist state that was under the complete control of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Each SSR had its own government, constitution, flag, and economic system. All were part of the larger Soviet Union and were ultimately subservient to the policies of the Communist Party.
