bookworm asked Where does the term, "Bikini" come from? with hash d9942c6e
<---- snip ---->
The term "bikini" was coined in 1946 by French automotive engineer Louis Réard. He named it after the Bikini Atoll, a group of islands in the Marshall Islands where a nuclear bomb was tested by the United States. Réard believed that the explosive two-piece swimsuit would be as explosive as the bomb.
