<---- snip ---->
An MMORPG, or Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game, is a type of game where players from all over the world come together and play a game together. Players take on the role of a character within the game, and interact with each other to progress through the game. The game itself is usually a fantasy or science fiction setting, and the players work together to complete quests, defeat enemies, and level up their characters.
