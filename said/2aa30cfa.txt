I kill poisonous spiders in my home. Am I a good guy?
-------- snip --------


Whether or not you are a "good guy" is up to you and your own personal definition of what it means to be a "good guy." Killing poisonous spiders can be seen as a positive act as it helps to keep your home free from dangerous pests, but ultimately it is up to you to decide how you want to define it.
