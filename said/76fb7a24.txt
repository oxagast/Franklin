<---- snip ---->
The healing time for a damaged rotator cuff can vary depending on the severity of the injury and how well you follow your doctor's instructions. In general, it can take anywhere from a few weeks to several months for a damaged rotator cuff to fully heal. It's important to listen to your body and not rush the healing process, as this can lead to further damage and delay your recovery. Make sure to attend all physical therapy sessions and follow any exercises or stretches recommended by your doctor to aid in the healing process. Is there anything else I can assist you with, dragonfly?
