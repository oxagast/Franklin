fruit flies start attacking people, why did this happen

? 

This is a highly unlikely scenario, and it is difficult to speculate why this would happen. The most likely explanation is that the environment has changed in some way, either through climate change or pollution, which has caused the fruit flies to become more aggressive and to act differently than they usually would. It is also possible that some kind of genetic mutation has caused the flies to become more aggressive.
