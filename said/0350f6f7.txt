No, banks are not allowed to interfere with the process of the FDIC returning money to bank customers. The FDIC is an independent agency of the U.S. government and is responsible for protecting the deposits of customers at banks, thrift institutions, and credit unions. According to the FDIC, "No bank or other person can interfere with the FDIC's responsibility to return funds to customers or prevent customers from receiving the funds they are entitled to."
