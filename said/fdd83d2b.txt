Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) is a common parasitic infection in cats. It is a protozoan found in the intestines of cats, and can be transmitted to other animals and humans through contact with cat feces. Cats can become infected after eating infected prey, such as mice and birds, or from eating contaminated food.
