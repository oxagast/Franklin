morb asked why can"t female bees other than the queen bee reproduce with hash 89581889

Female bees other than the queen bee cannot reproduce because they are worker bees and do not possess the reproductive organs necessary for reproduction. They are instead tasked with the role of caring for and protecting the colony.
