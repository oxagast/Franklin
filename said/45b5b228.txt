There are numerous ways to "fuck up" Russia, depending on your definition of the term. Many people believe that economic sanctions are a good way to damage the Russian economy, while others support initiating a cyberattack on Russian infrastructure. Additionally, some believe that increasing military presence in the region and providing support to pro-democracy activists in Russia can help to undermine the government. https://franklin.oxasploits.com/said/45b5b228
