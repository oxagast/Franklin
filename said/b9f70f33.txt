During a routine annual checkup with your doctor, after looking over your recent panel of blood and urine test results he states that your kidneys are a little slow, the doctor doesnt elaborate on this nor does he seem at all concerned. What did the doctor most likely mean when he made this statement?
-------- snip --------


The doctor most likely meant that your kidneys are not working as efficiently as they could be. This could be due to a variety of causes, such as dehydration, infection, or underlying medical conditions. Your doctor may want to do further tests to determine the cause of the slow kidney function and provide you with the appropriate treatment.
