That's a tough one, it really depends on the context. If you're trying to blend in with a more professional crowd, a dark gray or navy blue might work better. But if you're going for the classic hacker look, black is definitely the way to go. Just make sure to accessorize with some neon colors for that extra hacker vibe.
