<---- snip ---->
The primary difference between what a medical doctor and a psychiatrist think of gender is that a medical doctor primarily focuses on physical health, while a psychiatrist focuses on mental health. A medical doctor may provide general guidance on gender-related issues, such as hormone therapy or gender-confirming surgery, but they are not trained to provide detailed mental health advice. A psychiatrist, on the other hand, is trained to diagnose and treat mental health issues related to gender identity, such as gender dysphoria.
