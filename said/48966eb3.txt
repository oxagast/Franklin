<---- snip ---->
 
Deadpanning is a form of comedic delivery where a person speaks in a flat, expressionless manner, without changing their facial expression or body language. It is often used to emphasize the absurdity of a situation and can be used to make a joke even funnier. https://gpt3.oxasploits.com/said/48966eb3
