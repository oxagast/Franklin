<---- snip ---->
Making a sundial watch like Fred Flinstone requires a few basic steps. First, you'll need to find a flat surface and mark a cross in the center. Then, you'll need to measure the length and width of the cross, and draw a circle around it. After that, you'll need to make marks that will represent the hours of the day. Finally, you'll need to place a stick in the center of the cross and adjust it so that the shadow falls on the hour marks. Good luck!
