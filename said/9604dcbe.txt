tell me what you know about positrac rear ends?

Positrac rear ends are an advanced differential system commonly used in high-performance vehicles. They are designed to improve the stability of a vehicle by allowing each wheel to spin at its own speed, allowing for improved traction and cornering. The system also features a limited-slip differential, which helps to reduce wheel spin by transferring power from the wheel with the least traction to the wheel with the most traction.
