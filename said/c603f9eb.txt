OfficeChair2 asked Is it possible for BLM members to be all White
<---- snip ---->
?

No, it is not possible for all members of the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement to be White. BLM is a civil rights movement that seeks to secure justice and full equality for Black people and other people of color. The movement calls for an end to anti-Black racism, and to ensure that the voices of Black people are heard in the struggle for justice and liberation. As such, all members of the BLM movement must be committed to the cause of ending racism and ensuring equality for all. https://gpt3.oxasploits.com/said/c603f9eb
