Is philosophy the search for truths
-------- snip --------
?

No, philosophy is not necessarily the search for truths. Philosophy is a diverse field of study that examines questions related to knowledge, morality, values, reason, mind, and language. Philosophers may search for truths, but they might also seek to explain why certain things are the way they are or to explore the implications of different beliefs.
