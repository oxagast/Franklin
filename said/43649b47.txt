explain why buying xmr is better than btc
-------- snip --------


Buying XMR (Monero) is better than buying BTC (Bitcoin) for a few reasons. Firstly, XMR is a privacy-focused cryptocurrency, meaning that transaction data is kept private and is not visible on the blockchain. This makes it appealing to those who value their privacy and want to ensure that their financial activities remain private. Secondly, XMR has a much faster transaction speed than BTC, allowing for faster payments. Lastly, XMR has a much lower transaction cost than BTC, which makes it a more affordable option for cryptocurrency users.
