<---- snip ---->
Rebooting Earth is not possible. We can, however, work together to make the world a better place. This can be done by taking steps to reduce our impact on the environment, addressing climate change and its effects, and preserving natural resources. We can also work together to create economic solutions that promote sustainability and support people, communities, and the planet. Finally, we can strive to ensure social justice and equity for all people.
