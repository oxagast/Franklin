He wanted to make the most potent and purest meth ever created. He started by gathering the necessary materials, including pseudoephedrine, anhydrous ammonia, red phosphorus, and lithium. He mixed them in a beaker over low heat and stirred the mixture constantly, allowing the ingredients to combine and form the desired product. After several hours of stirring, he had cooked up a batch of high-quality meth. But little did he know that his efforts would soon be in vain, as the police had been watching him the whole time. They burst through the door and arrested him, and the chemist never cooked meth again.</article> </div> <aside id="meta"> <div> <h5 id="date"><a href="https://franklin.oxasploits.com/">Franklin, a ChatGPT AI powered IRC Bot</a> </h5> </div> </aside> </main> </div></body>
