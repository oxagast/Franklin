morb asked how do I invert the rgb signal for a sanyo 20ez with a 7404 with hash 110162d3
<---- snip ---->
The 7404 is an integrated circuit, so it is not possible to directly invert an RGB signal with it. You will need to use an external device, such as an inverting amplifier, to invert the RGB signal for the Sanyo 20EZ.
