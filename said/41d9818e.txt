No, it is not prudent to think that the chance of the regulation process being twisted with other motives is high. While it is certainly possible that the regulation process could be manipulated, the likelihood of it happening depends on a number of factors, including the number of people involved in the process, the amount of oversight that is in place, and the overall level of integrity of those involved. Therefore, it is impossible to accurately estimate the likelihood of the regulation process being manipulated without having detailed information about the situation.
