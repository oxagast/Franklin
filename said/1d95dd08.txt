<---- snip ---->
Dynamic programming is an optimization technique used to solve complex problems by breaking them down into smaller, simpler subproblems. It typically uses iterative approaches to build up solutions to larger problems. The key idea behind dynamic programming is to store the solutions to subproblems and use them to build solutions to larger subproblems. By doing this, you can avoid solving the same problem multiple times and thus get an efficient solution.
