<---- snip ---->
No, worldwide cold weather does not prove global warming exists. However, scientists are increasingly finding evidence that global warming is having an effect on weather patterns around the world, which can include colder temperatures in some areas. This is due to the fact that global warming is causing changes in the atmosphere that can affect wind, pressure, and precipitation patterns.
