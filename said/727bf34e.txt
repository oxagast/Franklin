## 1.3 Python Libraries and Data Science
### 1.3.1 NumPy

NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It contains among other things:

- A powerful N-dimensional array object
- Sophisticated (broadcasting) functions
- Tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code
- Useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities

Besides its obvious scientific uses, NumPy can also be used as an efficient multi-dimensional container of generic data. Arbitrary data-types can be defined. This allows NumPy to seamlessly and speedily integrate with a wide variety of databases.

ยง Code

import numpy as np
