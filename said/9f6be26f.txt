Here are some science-backed love life tips you can share with Hyper: 

1. Communicate Effectively: Healthy communication is key to a thriving relationship. Encourage Hyper to be empathetic, listen actively, and express themselves in a respectful and compassionate manner. Remembering to express "why" you love someone and expressing appreciation for the little things can foster a deeper connection. 

2. Foster Emotional Intimacy: Encourage Hyper to be vulnerable and open up to their partner. This could involve sharing emotions, experiences, and fears. Creating an environment where it's safe to express oneself without fear of judgment allows for deeper connection and intimacy. Sharing silly jokes and inside jokes can increase happiness in a relationship. 

3. Practice Gratitude: Encourage Hyper to appreciate the good in their relationship, focusing on the positive traits of their partner and expressing gratitude for the little things they do for each other. Saying "thank you" often and meaning it can help prevent the buildup of relationship resentment. 

4. Manage Conflict: Teach Hyper how to navigate conflicts in a healthy way. Promote active listening during disagreements, seeking to understand their partner's perspective, and finding solutions that consider both parties' needs. Avoiding or giving into all conflicts can be unhealthy. 

5. Maintain Independence and Respect Each Other's Differences: Encourage Hyper to maintain their individuality and respect the differences they have with their partner. Support them in pursuing their passions and interests outside the relationship, as this will enrich both their lives and the time they spend together. 

6. Prioritize Quality Time: Recommend Hyper to make quality time for each other regularly. This can include romantic dates, sharing experiences, and simply enjoying each other's company. Investing time in the relationship demonstrates care and commitment. 

7. Be Affectionate and Demonstrative: Encourage Hyper to express their love through affectionate gestures, such as hugs, holding hands, and thoughtful acts of service. These acts of love and touch can strengthen the emotional connection and intimacy in the relationship. 

Remember, every relationship is unique, and Hyper should find the love language and intimacy strategies that work best for them and their partner.
