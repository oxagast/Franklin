I boiled some bay leaves, now my home stinks. What do I do?

To get rid of the smell, try opening windows and doors to let in fresh air, and using fans to circulate the air. You can also try simmering a pot of water with a few tablespoons of vinegar, lemon slices, and cinnamon sticks. Finally, use air fresheners, essential oils, or scented candles to help mask the smell.
