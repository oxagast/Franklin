rpifan asked why are blade runners called that with hash d00dfdca
<---- snip ---->
The name "blade runner" comes from the futuristic film of the same name starring Harrison Ford. The movie follows a cop who is tasked with hunting down and eliminating "replicants" (artificial humans) who have gone rogue. The term "blade runner" was used to refer to the cop as they carried a long and thin blade as part of their equipment.
