write rhyme about how proge tried to tell people about xmr but they didnt listen so now theyre broke. Also mention dclaw
-------- snip --------


Proge tried to tell them all about XMR
His advice was sound, but they just wouldnt hear
They thought they knew better, what a mistake
Now their wallets are empty, and their dreams are all fake

The ones that did listen, didnt have to worry
They watched their investments soar, like a dclaw in a hurry
Now theyre living their best life, and doing just fine
While the others are left to ponder, what could have been their time
