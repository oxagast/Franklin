bookworm asked So covid at 0.27% infection is considered pandemic but humans not able to reproduce properly is considered not a pandemic? with hash c8488965
<---- snip ---->
No, humans not being able to reproduce properly would not be considered a pandemic. A pandemic is defined as an infection that affects a large number of people across the world in a short period of time. While the inability to reproduce may have a significant effect on the human population, it is not considered to be a pandemic.
