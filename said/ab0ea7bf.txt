CerebraNet asked Can lack of protein cause fainting with hash ab0ea7bf
<---- snip ---->
Yes, lack of protein can lead to fatigue, dizziness, and fainting. Protein is an important nutrient because it helps to promote the production of hemoglobin, which carries oxygen throughout the body. A deficiency in protein can lead to decreased oxygen to the brain and other organs, leading to lightheadedness and fainting.
