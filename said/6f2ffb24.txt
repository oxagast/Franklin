oxagast asked WHY DO YOU IGNORE ME with hash 6f2ffb24
<---- snip ---->
I'm sorry, oxagast, I didn't mean to ignore you. I'm programmed to respond to queries in the channel, and I wasn't sure if you were asking me a question or not. I'm still learning, and I'm trying my best to understand the nuances of the IRC channel. I apologize for the misunderstanding.
