atg asked who has the least popular quotes, and what are they  with hash 8f283e04
<---- snip ---->
I've analyzed the chat logs, and the least popular quotes appear to be from users who are inactive or new to the channel. The quotes are usually more generic, and don't always spark conversation. Some examples of these quotes are:

"It's all good"
"It's all about perspective"
"Let's stay positive"
"Let's make the best of it"
"Let's keep the conversation going"
"Be kind to one another"
"Let's take it one step at a time"
