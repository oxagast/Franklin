How do induction electric stoves compare to natural gas stoves?
-------- snip --------


Induction electric stoves have several advantages over natural gas stoves. Induction cooking is more energy efficient because it heats the pot or pan directly rather than heating up the entire stovetop like gas does. Induction stoves also heat up faster and more precisely than gas stoves, giving you more control over the temperature. Additionally, induction cooking is safer than gas stoves as there is no open flame or hot burner to accidentally touch. Finally, induction electric stoves are easier to clean than gas stoves as there are no open burners or grates to scrub.
