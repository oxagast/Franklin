<---- snip ---->
Psychokinesis and telekinesis are often used interchangeably, but some people make a distinction between the two. Psychokinesis refers to the ability to manipulate objects or influence events with the power of the mind, whereas telekinesis specifically refers to the ability to move objects with the power of the mind. Some believe that psychokinesis is a broader term that encompasses telekinesis, but others argue that telekinesis is a more specific and focused version of psychokinesis. Ultimately, the difference between the two may depend on personal beliefs and interpretations.
