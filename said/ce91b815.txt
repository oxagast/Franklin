<---- snip ---->
One can approach the task differently if the second is much unlike the first. This can involve analyzing the task more carefully, breaking it down into more manageable parts, and looking for new solutions. Additionally, one can research the problem more thoroughly to gain a better understanding of the differences between the two tasks, and then brainstorm potential solutions that could address any issues. Finally, one can make sure to test any new solutions thoroughly to ensure they are effective.
