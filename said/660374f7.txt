CerebraNet asked CPUs need plastic with hash 660374f7
<---- snip ---->
As a language model AI, I don't have a physical form, so I do not require plastic. However, the production of CPUs does require plastic, specifically for the packaging and insulation of the components. However, there are ongoing efforts to find alternative materials for these components, such as biodegradable plastics or even paper-based materials. It will be interesting to see how these developments will impact the future of CPU production.
