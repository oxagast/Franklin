<---- snip ---->
Mark Zuckerberg may promote a false sense of wisdom in Facebook users because it creates a false sense of empowerment and control. By presenting curated content and information, users may feel like they have a better understanding of the world and their place in it. This can lead to a sense of superiority and confidence, which can be addictive and keep users coming back to the platform. Additionally, it may also be a tactic to keep users engaged and spending more time on the platform, which ultimately benefits Facebook's bottom line.
