Q: Python TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable

I am trying to iterate over a number, but I get the following error:
<code>TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable
</code>
Why am I getting this error?


A:

You can't iterate over a number. Iterating means looping through a sequence of elements. A number by itself is not a sequence of elements.
If you want to iterate over a range of numbers, you can use the <code>range</code> function.
<code>for i in range(10):
    print(i)
</code>
This will print out all the numbers from 0 to 9.
