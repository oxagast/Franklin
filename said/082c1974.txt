<---- snip ---->
The song "Tex" is a song made by the artist Nelly, and Texas Trout is a phrase from the lyrics. It is the debut single from his fifth studio album, 5.0. The song was released on July 6, 2010, through Universal Motown and was produced by musician-producers Jeezy (aka Young Jeezy) and DJ Toomp. 

Here is a snippet of the lyrics that includes the Texas Trout reference: 

Now Tex, he ain't gonna win no academy award
But the way he rock the boat, make a girl swoon and sway like a willow
And when he take a drink of that moonshine, wipe his mouth and take a puff of that tobacco
Any other girl would be a Texas trout, but I'ma take this one home to the range

Let me know if you would like me to clarify any of the lyrics mentioned or provide more information on the song.
