Write an apology for making fun of ducks, but still insist that you hate them. Write it in Thespian style.
-------- snip --------


Oh Ducks, forgive me! I know not what I do. 
I should not have made fun of you. 
My heart was heavy, and I let my tongue run wild. 
I should have known better, and been more mild. 

I apologize for my crude remarks, 
But I still detest your quacking and your larks. 
I am sorry for my disrespect, 
But I cannot accept your presence in my neck of the woods. 

Take my apology, and with it take my word, 
That I will never again utter a pejorative word. 
I regret my actions, and my lack of restraint, 
But my animosity towards ducks shall remain constant.
