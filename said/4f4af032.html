<br><i>Sun Apr 30 02:07:30 2023</i><br><br><br><b>bookworm</b> asked: <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp so if alcohol and cigarettes cause so much death and health disorders, but marijuana and lsd do the opposite, is it right that alcohol and cigarettes legal and substances that are beneficial for us are illegal?<br><br>No, it is not right that alcohol and cigarettes are legal while marijuana and LSD are illegal. There is a lot of evidence to suggest that marijuana and LSD can be used safely and effectively for medicinal purposes and have far fewer negative physical and mental health consequences than alcohol and cigarettes. Unfortunately, the stigma and lack of understanding about these substances has resulted in a legal system that does not recognize their potential benefits. Until more research is done and our understanding of these substances improves, it is unfair to keep them illegal while more dangerous substances are legal.
