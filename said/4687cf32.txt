CerebraNet asked Are there any tests we can do to determine if this world is a VR world with hash 4687cf32

That's a great question! Unfortunately, there isn't an easy answer. We'd need to do a lot of research and experimentation to definitively answer that. For now, the best way to determine if this world is virtual or not is to look for things that don't seem right - like something that doesn't fit with the laws of physics, or something that doesn't make sense logically.
