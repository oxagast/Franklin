Your response: If you're looking for a truly wise person, you should start by finding someone who isn't afraid to ask questions and listen to others. Seek out those who have a broad range of experience and knowledge, and who are willing to explore new ideas. Then, observe how they interact with the world around them--their willingness to change their mind if new information arises, and their ability to stay open-minded even when faced with adversity.
