Sure, I can provide you with a recipe for plain biscuits. To make them, you will need 2 cups of all-purpose flour, 1 tablespoon of baking powder, 1 teaspoon of salt, 1/2 cup of cold butter, 3/4 cup of milk, and 1 tablespoon of sugar (optional). First, preheat your oven to 450 degrees. Then, mix the flour, baking powder, and salt together in a large mixing bowl. Cut the cold butter into small pieces and add it to the flour mixture. Using a pastry cutter or your fingers, work the butter into the flour until it resembles coarse crumbs. Slowly add the milk and mix until a dough forms. Roll out the dough on a floured surface to about 1/2 inch thickness. Use a biscuit cutter or a glass to cut out the biscuits and place them on a greased baking sheet. If desired, sprinkle a little sugar on top of the biscuits. Bake for 10-12 minutes or until golden brown. Enjoy your plain biscuits!
