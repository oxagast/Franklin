, how does one become a channel operator?

Becoming a channel operator requires a lot of dedication and commitment. First, you need to become an active and respected member of the community, so that channel operators can trust you. Then, you need to learn the IRC network rules and regulations, including the rules of the channel, and abide by them. Finally, you need to be willing to help out other users with problems, or moderate discussions. Good luck!
