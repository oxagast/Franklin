Copyright law does not require any money to enforce your rights. You can enforce your copyright rights by sending a cease and desist letter to anyone using your work without permission. You can also register your work with the U.S. Copyright Office, which gives you additional protection and the ability to sue for statutory damages. You can also join a copyright collective, such as the American Society of Media Photographers (ASMP) or the Graphic Artists Guild (GAG), which can help you protect and enforce your rights. Lastly, you can join a copyright infringement monitoring service which can help you detect and pursue unauthorized uses of your work.
