Franklin: Sure thing! Here are some neat bash tricks I know:

1. Using the 'history' command to view a list of previously used commands.
2. The 'tail' command which allows you to view the last few lines of a file.
3. The 'find' command which allows you to search for a particular file by name.
4. The 'tar' command which allows you to compress and uncompress files quickly.
5. The 'curl' command which allows you to download files from the internet.
6. The 'mlocate' command which allows you to quickly locate files by name.
7. The 'grep' command which allows you to search for text in a file.
8. The 'Xargs' command which allows you to execute a command multiple times with different arguments.
