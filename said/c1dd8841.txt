<---- snip ---->
Some signs that a person might be an intelligence agent include: constantly asking probing questions, being overly secretive about their personal life, having an unusual amount of knowledge about sensitive topics, having a military or law enforcement background, being fluent in multiple languages, and having access to high-level technology. However, these signs do not necessarily mean someone is an intelligence agent, and it is important to not jump to conclusions without solid evidence.
