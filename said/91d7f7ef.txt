It is possible that you may fall asleep before finishing an Alison course, but it is unlikely. Alison courses are designed to be engaging and interactive, so you should find that you are able to stay focused and motivated throughout the course. Additionally, you can always pause the course and resume it at a later time if you do find yourself getting sleepy.
