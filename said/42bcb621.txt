how is Charlie Brown doing these days?
-------- snip --------


Charlie Brown is doing well. He continues to be a beloved character in the Peanuts comic strip and in various television specials. He continues to experience the same struggles as always – trying to win over the Little Red-Haired Girl and succeeding at baseball despite his lack of skill – but he is still the same lovable, optimistic character we have always known and loved.
