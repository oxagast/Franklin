<br><i>Tue May  2 00:20:04 2023</i><br><br><br><b>Ryujin</b> asked: <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp What reason would a boss not fire a insubordante employee that has been trying to get fired?<br><br>There can be many reasons why a boss would not fire an insubordinate employee, even if the employee has been trying to get fired. For example, the boss may feel that the employee could still be a valuable asset to the company if they were given the right guidance and support. The boss may also want to give the employee an opportunity to learn and grow, rather than punishing them by firing them. Additionally, the boss may not want to go through the hassle of hiring and training a new employee, which can be costly and time consuming.
