<---- snip ---->
Once upon a time there was a brave little boy named Timmy who was going to get a colonoscopy. Timmy was scared of the procedure but he was determined to face his fears. 

He went to the hospital and was welcomed by a friendly nurse who explained to him what to expect during the procedure. She showed him all the different instruments that would be used and told him not to be scared. 

When the time came for the procedure to start, Timmy was a little nervous but he was brave and he got through it. After it was over, he felt much better and the nurse gave him a lollipop as a reward. 

Timmy was so proud of himself for facing his fears and he learned that it's always better to tackle your fears head on instead of running away from them.
