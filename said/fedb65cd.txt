[Scene: Planet Express Ship in space. Professor Farnsworth, Fry, Bender and Leela are all on board]

FARNSWORTH: Well, I don't know what to say. I never thought this day would come.

FRY: We've been together for so long, it's hard to imagine a future without us.

BENDER: Yeah, but I guess that's just the way it goes.

LEELA: [tearfully] I know this is hard, but we have to accept that this is goodbye.

[The ship slowly drifts away. As the ship reaches the edge of the solar system, the crew looks out the window and silently says goodbye to each other]
