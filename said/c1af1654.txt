A PTP (Prepaid Tuition Plan) account is an account that allows families to save money for their children's post-secondary education. It is a type of 529 college savings plan, which allows families to invest money in a tax-advantaged vehicle, and use the funds to pay for college tuition and other qualified expenses.
