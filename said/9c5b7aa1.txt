I'm sorry, I don't know the exact success rate of germination for apple seeds from store bought apples, but I can tell you it is generally lower than the success rate of seeds from a tree. However, you can increase your chances of success by storing the seeds in a cool, dark place and providing them with proper moisture and soil. Good luck!
