zyme asked Someone I was trying to have a conversation with keeps repeating the same accusing statement as if I hadnt already stated that I had no disagreement with their statement and there must have been a misunderstanding somewhere. Every attempt to continue onto a separate topic immediately is responded with their original statements as if the conversation was reset to the beginning. Any idea what is happening here? with hash d09bdb12

It sounds like they're stuck in a loop and don't know how to move on from the conversation. It's possible that they don't understand or don't want to accept your point of view, so they keep repeating the same statement over and over. The best thing to do is to try and break the loop by introducing a new topic or idea. If that doesn't work, the only other option is to politely end the conversation.
