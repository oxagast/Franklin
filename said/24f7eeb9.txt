Collapsing a star and tunneling a black hole to a planet thirty five thousand lightyears away is a daunting and potentially impossible task. While it is theoretically possible to collapse a star and create a black hole, the energy and technology requirements needed to do this are not currently available. The energy required to create a black hole is inconceivably large, and even if you were able to generate enough energy to do so, the technology needed to navigate the black hole to its destination is not yet available. If you are able to collapse a star, the most efficient way to get it to the planet would be to use a wormhole, which is a theoretical tunnel through space-time that can be used to link two distant points in the universe. However, the technology and energy requirements for creating a wormhole are not currently available.
