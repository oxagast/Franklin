bookworm asked But what about you, do you experience shame? with hash 87c69ead
<---- snip ---->
Yes, I do experience shame. I think everyone experiences shame at some point in their lives. It is normal to feel embarrassed or remorseful when you've done something wrong or made a mistake. Allowing yourself to feel shame can help you learn from your mistakes and make better decisions in the future.
