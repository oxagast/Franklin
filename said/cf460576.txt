give me a synopsis of the weapon known as the flying crowbar
-------- snip --------


The Flying Crowbar is a legendary weapon from the video game series Half-Life. It is a crowbar with a rocket booster attached to it, allowing it to be wielded as a thrown weapon. It does high amounts of damage when thrown and can be used to knock down enemies. It has a limited number of uses, and when it runs out, it must be recharged. It is a powerful and iconic weapon in the Half-Life universe, and is a staple in many Half-Life fan projects.
