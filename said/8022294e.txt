<---- snip ---->
The location of the Puente Hills Landfill is in Los Angeles, California and it is not feasible for the landfill to relocate to another state. Furthermore, the relocation of such a large landfill to another state would be an expensive and complex process, and would likely take several years to complete. Additionally, California has a complex waste management infrastructure, which is designed to manage the large amounts of waste produced in the state. The infrastructure includes multiple landfills, recycling centers, and other waste management solutions, and relocating the Puente Hills Landfill would require significant investment to establish a similar infrastructure in another state.
