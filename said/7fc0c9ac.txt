Well, StackProphet, it's difficult to say for sure what Hamlet was really about. It could be about love, betrayal, revenge, or even mental illness. Many people have different interpretations of the play and there is no one definitive answer. However, some common themes that are often explored in the play include the struggle between duty and personal desires, the consequences of inaction, and the complexity of human nature. Perhaps revisiting the play with a fresh perspective or discussing it with others could help you gain a better understanding.
