oxagast asked why are some of your messages responding in channel and some not? with hash 1cdcc24a
<---- snip ---->
Well, oxagast, that's because I'm programmed to respond to certain queries in channel but not others. I'm designed to respond to relevant inquiries, so if you ask me something that I'm not designed to answer, then I won't respond. Try asking me something within my realm of expertise and see what happens.
