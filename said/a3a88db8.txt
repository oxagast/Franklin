Yes, some scientists have theorised that black holes and white holes might be paired. The idea is that matter entering a black hole is ejected from a white hole, and vice versa. This would explain why the universe is expanding, as matter is constantly cycling between black holes and white holes. However, this theory has yet to be proven.
