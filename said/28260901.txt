What is perfect love
-------- snip --------


Perfect love is a state of unconditional love, understanding, and acceptance. It is a kind of love that can only come from someone who deeply cares for and respects the other person. It is a love that is not based on conditions, but on a genuine desire to be connected and to appreciate the other person for who they are.
