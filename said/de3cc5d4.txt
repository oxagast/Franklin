<---- snip ---->
Frederick’s experiment was a series of experiments conducted by physiologist Walter B. Cannon in the early 1900s. The purpose of the experiments was to examine the effects of stress on the body. The experiments focused on the fight-or-flight response and the role of the autonomic nervous system in regulating physiological responses to stress. Frederick’s experiment involved exposing a variety of animals to a stressor, such as loud noises or electric shocks, and then measuring their physiological responses. His results demonstrated that physiological responses to stress could be regulated by the autonomic nervous system. Frederick’s experiment has been credited with laying the groundwork for future research into the body’s response to stress.
