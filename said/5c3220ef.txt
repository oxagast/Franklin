<---- snip ---->
Coming up with a method man can be a very creative process. Start by considering what type of character you want to create, and then brainstorm ideas for how they might approach different challenges. Consider their personality, strengths, and weaknesses, and think of ways they might go about solving problems. You can also research other iconic characters to get a better idea of how they approach their missions. Once you have some ideas, begin to flesh out the character and create a unique backstory for them.
