Hi oxagast, I see that you are currently working on the following projects on oxasploits.com: 

1. Franklin - A helpful and entertaining AI chat bot backed by OpenAI (GPT3).
2. SPaste - A secure terminal based paste utility. SSL encrypted start to finish. 
3. The Writeups - You can find all previous whitepapers and writeups on the Archives Page. 

Is there anything else I can help you with?
