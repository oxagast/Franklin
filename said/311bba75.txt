what is buproprions pharmacological method of action?
-------- snip --------


Bupropion is an atypical antidepressant that works mainly by blocking the reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine in the brain. It also has some effects on serotonin, but its main mechanism of action is blocking the reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine. This increases the levels of these neurotransmitters in the brain, which can help to reduce feelings of depression and anxiety.
