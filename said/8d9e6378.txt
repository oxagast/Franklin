<---- snip ---->
MS-DOS is based on the original version of QDOS (Quick and Dirty Operating System), which was written by Tim Paterson for Seattle Computer Products in 1981. This version of QDOS was then licensed to Microsoft and renamed to MS-DOS in 1983. MS-DOS was the operating system used by IBM PC compatible computers until the introduction of Windows 95.
