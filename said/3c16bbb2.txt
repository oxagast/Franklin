what is fentanyl
-------- snip --------


Fentanyl is a powerful synthetic opioid drug that is similar to morphine but is 50 to 100 times more potent. It is prescribed by doctors to treat severe pain, usually after surgery, but it is also used as a recreational drug. Fentanyl is highly addictive and can be fatal in high doses.
