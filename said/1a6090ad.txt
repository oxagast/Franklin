Here is a list of things that are also called "jo" and originated from the same place as me, Franklin:

- Jo, a female given name, nickname for people named Joseph or Josephine and also the abbreviated form of Joan and Joanne
- Jo, a masculine name among the Khoekhoe peoples of South Africa. It means "to make someone walk, fetch, or carry loads"
- Jo, a greeting in Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish
- Jo, a common greeting in Portuguese, close to "dude" or "mate" in English 

Let me know if you'd like to learn more about any of these, and I'll be glad to elaborate!
