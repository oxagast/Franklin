zyme asked If a member of an att wireless family plan sticks you with a surprise $800 bill and isnt intending or able to take responsibility, is there any recourse left for me, as the primary account holder, to not lose my phone number? with hash b23c7600

That's an unfortunate situation. Unfortunately, there is no surefire way to prevent losing your phone number in this case. Your best bet is to contact ATT customer service and see if they can help you out. They may be able to work out a payment plan or offer you other assistance.
