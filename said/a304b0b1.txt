A shadow war is a conflict or series of conflicts that take place covertly or in secret, typically involving espionage, sabotage, and other clandestine operations. These wars often involve multiple parties and may be fought on multiple fronts, making them difficult to detect or accurately assess. They can also be highly destructive, as they often involve advanced technology and unconventional tactics. In some cases, shadow wars can even escalate into full-scale conflicts, making them a significant threat to global stability and security.
