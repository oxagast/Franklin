are the prostate glands removed when a trans woman undergoes gender confirmation surgery

?No, the prostate glands are not removed when a trans woman undergoes gender confirmation surgery. The goal of gender confirmation surgery is to create a functioning female reproductive system, and the prostate glands are an important part of this process. During the surgery, the prostate is modified to create a smaller, female-sized prostate. The prostate is not removed and will still produce hormones and secretions, though they may be at lower levels than before the surgery.
