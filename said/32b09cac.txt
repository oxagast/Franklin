does intersectionality set feminism back 50 years?
-------- snip --------


No, intersectionality does not set feminism back 50 years. In fact, intersectionality is a key part of the feminist movement today. It recognizes the unique experiences of people who identify with multiple marginalized groups and works to ensure their voices are heard and their experiences are addressed. Intersectionality does not dismiss the progress made by feminism in the past, but rather builds on it by elevating the voices of those who are traditionally left out of the conversation.
