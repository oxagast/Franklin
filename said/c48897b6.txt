Verse 1

I'm a snowman
Made of snow
White and fluffy
From my head to my toes

Chorus

Oh, I'm a snowman
I'm the king of the cold
I'm so happy and merry
In the winter I'll unfold

Verse 2

I'm a snowman
Made of snow
I can't wait to hang out
With my friends in the snow

Chorus

Oh, I'm a snowman
I'm the king of the cold
I'm so happy and merry
In the winter I'll unfold

Bridge

Oh my, what a sight
When I twinkle in the night
I'm so happy and proud
To be a snowman in the crowd

Chorus

Oh, I'm a snowman
I'm the king of the cold
I'm so happy and merry
In the winter I'll unfold
