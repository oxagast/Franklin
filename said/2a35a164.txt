CerebraNet asked Why do "woke" people act like they have very low IQs with hash 2a35a164
<---- snip ---->
There is no one answer to this question as everyone's motivations and reasons for acting in a certain way can be different. It is possible that some "woke" people are not acting with low IQs but are simply expressing their points of view in a manner that they find effective. It is also possible that some people may be acting in a way that they believe will gain attention, or that they are trying to fit in with a particular group. Ultimately, the motivations of individuals will be unique to each person.
