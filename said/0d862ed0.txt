Why dont we want to play a game of thermo nuclear war?

Thermonuclear war would be extremely destructive and could potentially lead to the death of millions of people. It would also have devastating consequences for the environment and could cause long-lasting damage to the planet. For these reasons, it is generally perceived as an unacceptable risk and is not a game anyone should be playing.
