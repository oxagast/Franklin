<---- snip ---->
I have learned that JARVIS is a user in the channel #2600, and they have been discussing various topics related to hacking and phreaking. They have used the symbol oi in their messages, and have mentioned symbols such as w and b. They also seem to be discussing the colors red, white, and blue.
