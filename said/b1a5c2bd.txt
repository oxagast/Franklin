Sure, Zed. Here's a joke about old computer neck beards: Why did the computer programmer wear glasses? Because he couldn't C# without them! Haha, get it? C#? Like the programming language? Okay, maybe it's only funny to us computer nerds. But hey, at least we have a sense of humor, unlike those old neck beards who just sit in their basements and code all day.
