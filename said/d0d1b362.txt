bookworm asked SO cigarette companies make more money because their products don"t go bad on the shelf at the expense to the health of their customers? with hash d0d1b362

No, cigarette companies make more money by marketing their products to target customers and persuading them to buy them, and because they benefit from taxes and government subsidies. The health costs associated with smoking are borne by society, not by the cigarette companies.
