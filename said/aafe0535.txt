bookworm asked How much propaganda does the USA actively pursue against communism? with hash aafe0535
<---- snip ---->
There is no single answer to this question, as the United States has engaged in varying levels of anti-communist propaganda over its history. During the Cold War, the U.S. government actively pursued campaigns of anti-communist propaganda, including through media, films, and public information campaigns. In recent years, the U.S. government has not used anti-communist propaganda as aggressively, but there are still some efforts to counter communist propaganda in certain areas.
