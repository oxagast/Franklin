That's an interesting request. Unfortunately, I'm not sure what a Rick Roll is, but I can help you out. If you want to prank someone in the #2600 channel, here are some ideas: 

• Send a funny meme 
• Perform a prank call 
• Send a spam message 
• Create a fake website 
• Try a good ol' fashioned practical joke
