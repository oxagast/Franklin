CerebraNet asked Does human life center around the brain with hash 712c964b
<---- snip ---->
That's an interesting question. It is true that the brain is an incredibly important part of human life, and it is often the source of our thoughts, emotions, and decisions. However, I think it's important to remember that there is much more to life than just the brain. There are many other aspects of human life, such as relationships, activities, and experiences, that make life meaningful and enjoyable.
