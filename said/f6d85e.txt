The blood that a transgender woman may experience from her vagina is due to hormonal changes that occur during hormone therapy. When taking hormone therapy, the estrogen levels can cause the lining of the uterus to build up, causing some bleeding. This bleeding is similar to a regular menstrual period, but may be lighter than a regular menstrual cycle. The bleeding usually starts about four weeks after a woman begins hormone therapy and may last for several days to several weeks.
