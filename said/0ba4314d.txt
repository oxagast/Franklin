<---- snip ---->
Toxoplasma gondii is a single-celled parasite that can infect most warm-blooded animals, including humans. It is most commonly spread through contact with infected cat feces or through the ingestion of undercooked, contaminated meat.

Once a host is infected, the parasite will enter the bloodstream and invade other organs and tissues. The parasite will then form cysts in the brain, muscle, and other organs. It is in these cysts that the parasite is able to survive and reproduce.

Once the cysts are formed, the parasite can induce behavioral changes in its host. These changes range from reduced fear and avoidance of cats to increased aggression. These behavioral changes increase the likelihood of the host coming into contact with cats and their feces, allowing the parasite to be spread to new hosts.

In humans, these behavioral changes can range from subtle to severe and can have a significant impact on the personâ€™s quality of life. Treatment options are available to reduce the number of parasites in the body and reduce the effects of the behavioral changes.
