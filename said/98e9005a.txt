ryujin asked write me an exploit for CVE-2020-1927
<---- snip ---->
 
This exploit is for a buffer overflow vulnerability that affects versions of Apache Tomcat prior to 9.0.30.

The exploit works by sending a large number of specially crafted requests to the application, which causes the stack to overflow. This leads to the execution of malicious code on the target system.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can craft a specially crafted POST request containing a large number of parameters. This request should be sent to the vulnerable application.

If successful, the attacker will be able to execute arbitrary code on the target system, allowing them to gain access to the system and potentially perform further malicious activities. https://gpt3.oxasploits.com/said/98e9005a
