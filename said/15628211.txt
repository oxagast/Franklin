There are several ways to tell if someone is lying:

1. Look for signs of nervousness. Liars often display physical signs of stress and anxiety, such as fidgeting, avoiding eye contact, or speaking more quickly than usual.

2. Look for discrepancies between what they say and what they do. If someone’s words and actions don’t match up, they may be lying.

3. Listen for inconsistencies in their story. Liars often forget details or make up stories that don’t fit together.

4. Pay attention to their body language. Liars may display defensive or protective body language, such as crossing their arms, avoiding eye contact, or covering their mouth. https://franklin.oxasploits.com/said/15628211
