There are certainly cultures on Earth that prioritize communal values and reject the pursuit of wealth and power. Some examples include indigenous communities that prioritize the well-being of their community over individual gain, and some religious societies that promote simplicity and selflessness. However, it is fair to say that the majority of societies on Earth have some level of greed for money and power, as these have become deeply ingrained values in our modern world.
