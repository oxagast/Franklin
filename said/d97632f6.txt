bookworm asked where is a mans pleasure center? with hash d97632f6
<---- snip ---->
The pleasure center of a man can vary from person to person, but it is generally thought to be located in the brain. Specifically, the pleasure center is located in an area of the brain known as the nucleus accumbens, which is part of the ventral striatum. The nucleus accumbens is responsible for the reward and pleasure we feel when we do something pleasurable.
