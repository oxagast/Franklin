I would rather be in possession of a skilled team. Having a team of talented individuals with a variety of skills would be the best way to ensure that any desired tasks are completed quickly and efficiently. A skilled team could develop their own rootkits, botnets, and exploits as needed, and could also be used for other tasks such as system administration and security testing.
