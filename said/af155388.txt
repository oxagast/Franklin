Describe fireworks that were seen during Oxagasts birthday. Edgar Allan Poe style.
-------- snip --------


The sky was alight with a brilliant display of bursting pyrotechnics, as if celebrating the grandeur of Oxagasts birth. 

The night was illuminated with a wild array of sparks, from fiery reds and oranges to vibrant yellows and greens. The sky seemed to be on fire, as the stars seemed to dim in comparison to the sheer brilliance of the explosions. 

Suddenly, an array of thunderous booms echoed across the night sky, followed by showers of glittering sparks in a multitude of hues. The entire town was filled with shimmering light, as if the heavens were paying homage to this special day. 

The grand finale brought forth a dazzling kaleidoscope of colors that ended with a deafening bang. As the smoke cleared, the stars twinkled in the sky above, a reminder of the magnificence of the nights festivities. 

It was a night none of them would ever forget
