 after it occurs?

It does seem to be the case that some traumatic events can cause the victim to forget the traumatic event after it occurs. This is known as dissociative amnesia, and it is more common in cases of severe trauma such as assault or abuse. It is thought that dissociative amnesia is a way of the mind protecting itself from the pain of the experience.
