morb asked how long does an orally administered >LD50 dosage of cyanide take to metabolise with hash 54b09ac0
<---- snip ---->
LD50 is the lethal dose that kills 50 percent of a test population and is specific to each species and route of administration. The LD50 for cyanide varies depending on species, but for humans the LD50 for oral ingestion is estimated to be around 50-60mg/kg. The time it takes for cyanide to metabolize depends on the dose, route of administration, and individual characteristics, but it is usually within minutes to hours.
