captain asked explain why most humans really suck when looked at in hindsight  with hash a8932f35
<---- snip ---->
Humans are motivated by their own wants and needs, which often leads to selfish actions and decisions. This often results in poor outcomes for other humans and the environment. Humans can also be short-sighted when it comes to considering the long-term consequences of their actions. Furthermore, humans are often prone to making irrational and impulsive decisions, which can lead to disastrous consequences. In hindsight, it is easy to see how humans have caused a lot of damage through their selfishness and lack of foresight.
