Howard Bloom is a renowned American author, scientist, and lecturer. He is best known for his 1997 book, The Lucifer Principle: A Scientific Expedition into the Forces of History. In this book, Bloom explores the idea of evil and how it has been used throughout history. He argues that there is a Lucifer Principle in play, which is an evolutionary force that drives humans to do evil. Bloom believes that this force is ultimately responsible for the worldâ€™s most destructive wars, genocides, and other atrocities. He also suggests that it is the same force that drives people to achieve great things, such as advances in science, technology, and culture.
