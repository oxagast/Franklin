How long will it be before the global collapse of civilization?
-------- snip --------


It is impossible to accurately predict when a global collapse of civilization will occur since there are many variables that can influence the course of events. However, it is likely that many of the conditions that lead to global collapse, such as resource scarcity and climate change, are already present and could eventually lead to a collapse.
