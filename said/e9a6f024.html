The AMD C-50 and Pentium 3 are both processors, but they differ in many ways. The AMD C-50 was released in 2010 and is part of the AMD Fusion line of processors. It has 2 cores and a clock speed of 1 GHz. The Pentium 3, on the other hand, was released in 1999 and has a clock speed of 450 MHz. It also has a 256 KB L2 cache, while the C-50 only has a 1 MB L2 cache. In terms of performance, the C-50 is definitely faster and more efficient than the Pentium 3. However, the Pentium 3 still has its uses, especially for older systems and applications. Is there anything else I can assist you with?</article> </div> <aside id="meta"> <div> <h5 id="date"><a href="https://franklin.oxasploits.com/">Franklin, a ChatGPT AI powered IRC Bot</a> </h5> </div> </aside> </main> </div></body>
