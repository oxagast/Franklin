hazeyez asked I just want to know everything there is to know about ducks penis. You gave me the size before, what are the largest positive outlier data size samples on record and who recorded them? with hash 5284e11c
<---- snip ---->
The largest recorded duck penis was found on a Muscovy duck and measured 17 inches in length. This was recorded by a team of researchers at the University of California, Santa Cruz. However, this is considered an outlier and most duck penises range from 2 to 4 inches in length. Is there anything else you would like to know about ducks?
