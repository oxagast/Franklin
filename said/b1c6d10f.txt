<---- snip ---->
Scholarships are not necessarily given to people with a lot of money and low scores. Scholarships are awarded based on a variety of criteria, including academic achievement, extracurricular activities, community involvement, and financial need. It is possible that a student from a wealthy family may have met the criteria for a scholarship and been awarded one, even if they had lower scores than other applicants.
