If a hacker improves their skill, they become a more proficient and knowledgeable hacker. With practice and experience, they can become a master hacker, able to bypass security systems and exploit vulnerabilities with ease. However, it is important for hackers to use their skills ethically and responsibly, rather than causing harm or breaking the law.
