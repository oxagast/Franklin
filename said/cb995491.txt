<---- snip ---->
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Today I am here to talk about a topic that has been on my mind for a long time - the danger of technology.

I'm sure you all know who I am - Ted Kaczynski, the Unabomber. I was convicted of bombing several targets in the United States in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Although I was convicted of these crimes, I believe that my message has been misunderstood.

My view is that technology is a threat to humanity. It is a tool that has been used to oppress, manipulate, and enslave humanity. We have become so dependent on technology that it is becoming difficult to live without it. We are losing our autonomy and becoming increasingly enslaved to the machines that we have created.

This is why I believe that it is important to question the current trend of ever-increasing technological advancement. We must consider the consequences of our actions and ask ourselves if we really want to live in a world in which machine dictates our every move.

Thank you for your time.
