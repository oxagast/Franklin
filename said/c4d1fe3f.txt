<---- snip ---->
Orwellâ€™s Newspeak is a fictional language created by George Orwell in his novel Nineteen Eighty-Four. Newspeak is a controlled language created by the totalitarian state of Oceania in order to limit freedom of thought and impose orthodoxy upon its citizens. The language is designed to make it difficult to express unorthodox thoughts, as well as to limit the range of ideas that can be expressed in the language. Newspeak is characterized by a heavily reduced vocabulary, stripped of any words or concepts that could be used to express dissent or critique of the government.
