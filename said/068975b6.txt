's representatives on Earth?

Many Catholic leaders believe they are God's representatives on Earth because they are seen as being stewards of God's will. They believe that God has called them to serve as His messengers, to bring His teachings to the world and to lead others to follow His commands. They are also seen as being responsible for helping others understand and obey the teachings of the Catholic Church, and for helping to bring about a greater level of spiritual and moral harmony in the world.
