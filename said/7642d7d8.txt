<---- snip ---->
Tardigrades are microscopic animals that can be found in water, soil, and moss. They feed on algae, bacteria, fungi, plant and animal cells, and even some other microscopic organisms. They have four pairs of claw-like legs and feed by sucking the cytoplasm out of their prey. They also have a specialized mouthpart called a “buccal tube” which they can use to drill into their prey and suck out the contents.
