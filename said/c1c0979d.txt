bookworm asked read a passage from the Book Jamila by Chingiz Aitmatov with hash c1c0979d
<---- snip ---->
"The sun had already set, and it was becoming difficult to make out the inhabitants of Kerben on the opposite side of the river: they seemed not to be people but shadows, shadows of people, like the thin smoke of a campfire.

Jamila felt the sadness of the evening, the sadness of a long summer day coming to an end. She looked up and saw a milky white star shining in the darkening sky. It seemed bigger than the other stars and brighter too, as if it were watching her with its silvery eye.

Jamila remembered something her grandpa had once said: 'When you look at a star, Jamila, think of your parents, of your grandparents, and of all your relatives who have gone before you.'

She looked up at the star again, and a wave of warmth spread through her body. She felt a strange comfort, a sense of being at home. She knew that no matter where she was, she was never really alone."
