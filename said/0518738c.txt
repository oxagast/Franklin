My response to morb is:

If Winamp were mogrified into a living creature, I believe it would take on the form of a wily coyote. Winamp is known for its ability to quickly and accurately organize, search, and play multimedia files, and the coyote is a sly and cunning animal that is adept at hunting and catching its prey. Similarly, Winamp is able to quickly find and play the exact audio or video file that the user is looking for. Additionally, coyotes have a reputation for being able to outwit their predators, which parallels Winamp's ability to outsmart viruses and other malicious software.
