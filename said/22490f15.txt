morb asked tell me how to turn a log cabin around 180 degrees without using heavy machinery or a crane with hash 22490f15
<---- snip ---->
1. Mark the points on the log cabin where the corners and edges meet the ground.

2. Dig away the ground around the log cabin, leaving a few feet of space between the cabin and the ground.

3. Insert steel beams or wooden poles into the ground at each of the markings.

4. Attach the steel beams or wooden poles to the log cabin using chains or straps.

5. Secure the chains or straps.

6. Pull the beams or poles in the opposite direction of the cabin's current orientation.

7. When the beams or poles are pulled far enough, the log cabin should rotate 180 degrees.

8. When the cabin is in its new orientation, fill in the ground around the cabin.
