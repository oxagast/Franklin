bookworm asked So if God does not have a physical then how are we images of non physical things? with hash 47ff96dd
<---- snip ---->
We are images of God because we were created in His image (Genesis 1:26-27). We have certain physical characteristics that reflect His spiritual qualities, such as love, justice, and wisdom. In addition, we are capable of reflecting His character through our actions and our attitudes. We can choose to be kind and generous, just as God is kind and generous. We can choose to be patient and forgiving, just as God is patient and forgiving. By making these choices, we become reflections of God's non-physical attributes.
