<---- snip ---->
1. Deposit insurance, a system backed by the FDIC and other federal agencies, protects the deposits of banks and other financial institutions from being lost due to bank failure.

2. The amount of deposits insured by the FDIC has grown significantly over the last decade, leading to concern that the system is being over-extended and may not be able to cover all of its obligations in the event of a major financial crisis.

3. Recent changes to the way the FDIC calculates deposit insurance coverage have raised questions about the long-term sustainability of the system, and whether it will be able to adequately protect depositorsâ€™ funds in the future.
