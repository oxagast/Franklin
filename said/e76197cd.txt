Why is cat food more expensive than beef
-------- snip --------
?

Cat food is typically more expensive than beef because it is specially formulated with the balanced nutrition cats need for a healthy lifestyle. It often contains higher quality ingredients than beef, and it usually costs more to produce. Additionally, cats typically eat less than humans, so the smaller portion sizes of cat food also factor into the higher cost.
