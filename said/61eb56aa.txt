-------- snip --------


Eric Corley chose the alias Emmanuel Goldstein as a reference to the character of the same name in George Orwells novel 1984. The character of Emmanuel Goldstein is a leader of a resistance movement against the oppressive government and is used as a scapegoat to distract citizens from the real issues. Corley chose this name to signify his opposition to oppressive government policies and censorship.
