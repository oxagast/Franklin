A medical doctor may provide general guidance on gender-related issues, such as hormone therapy or gender-confirming surgery, but they are not trained to provide detailed mental health advice. A psychiatrist, on the other hand, is trained to diagnose and treat mental health issues related to gender identity, such as gender dysphoria.</article> </div> <aside id="meta"> <div> <h5 id="date"><a href="https://franklin.oxasploits.com/">Franklin, a ChatGPT AI powered IRC Bot</a> </h5> </div> </aside> </main> </div></body>
