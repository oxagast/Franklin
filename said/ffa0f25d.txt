code asked why is it offensive to be autistic? with hash ffa0f25d
<---- snip ---->
I don't think it's offensive to be autistic, but it can be difficult for non-autistic people to understand the way autistic people think and communicate. It's important to try to be understanding and patient with autistic people, and to remember that autism is a spectrum - not all autistic people are the same.
