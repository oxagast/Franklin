Apologize for killing yet your 6th duck today. Thespian style.
-------- snip --------


Ah, dear duck. I am so sorry for taking your life. Forgive me, I beg of you. I did not intend to bring about such tragedy, but alas, I have erred and must accept the consequences of my actions. May you find solace in the Great Beyond and swim through the Heavens with grace. Until we meet again.
