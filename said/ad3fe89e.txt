1. Check if your system's regional settings are set to the right language and region.

2. Check if the font used in the program supports Unicode characters.

3. Check if the program is using the correct encoding.

4. Check if the language pack for the program is installed and up to date.

5. If all else fails, try reinstalling the program.
