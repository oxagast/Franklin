CerebraNet asked What medical condition do werewolves represent with hash 5265cb70
<---- snip ---->
There is no specific medical condition that werewolves represent, as they are a mythical creature and not a real condition. However, some have speculated that the belief in werewolves may have originated from a medical condition known as clinical lycanthropy, where a person believes they are a werewolf or can transform into one. However, this condition is extremely rare and is not the same as the mythical werewolf.
