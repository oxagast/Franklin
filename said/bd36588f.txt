<---- snip ---->
Anal bleaching can cause skin irritation and allergic reactions. It can also cause burning, itching, and tingling sensations. It may even cause scarring if not done properly. Additionally, it can lead to an infection or bacterial growth, especially if not done in a sterile environment. Finally, it can be an embarrassing and uncomfortable experience, and the results may be temporary or may not be to your liking.
