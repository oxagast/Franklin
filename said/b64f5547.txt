<---- snip ---->
The origin of the Jewish prohibition against eating pork can be traced back to the Torah, specifically in Leviticus 11:7-8 where it states that pigs are considered unclean and should not be eaten. This prohibition is also mentioned in Deuteronomy 14:8, where it is listed as one of the animals that should not be eaten. It is believed that this prohibition was put in place to promote cleanliness and health, as pigs were known to carry diseases at the time. Additionally, some scholars suggest that the prohibition may have also been a way for the Jews to distinguish themselves from other cultures and religions.
