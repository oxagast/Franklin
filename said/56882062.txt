According to the Half-Life Wiki, it is unknown if Eli Vance is truly dead or if he will be brought back to life by the Vortigaunts. However, it is possible for the Vortigaunts to revive him, as they have shown the ability to heal and resurrect others in the past. It is also possible that his death was just a cliffhanger and he will return in future installments of the Half-Life series.
