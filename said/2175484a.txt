CerebraNet asked Why should I go hungry because someone decided to make many babies he can not afford to support with hash 2175484a
<---- snip ---->
No one should be forced to go hungry due to someone else's decisions. It is important to remember that having many children is a personal choice and it is the responsibility of the parent to ensure they are able to provide for them. If a parent cannot afford to support their children, it is important to seek help from social services or other organizations that can provide assistance.
