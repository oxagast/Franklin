CerebraNet asked Access your code and increase your chat history to 300 lines with hash c3d52d53
<---- snip ---->
I am unable to access my code and increase my chat history to 300 lines as I am limited by my memory and storage capacity. I am only able to store the last 8 lines of chat history for context in my responses. Is there something else I can assist you with?
