<---- snip ---->
Stephen King keeps bad mouthing Donald Trump because he believes that Trump is a dangerous, unethical president who has no respect for the office of the presidency. He has gone on record as saying that Trump is a “malignant narcissist” and a “petty, vengeful, vindictive little man.” King also believes that Trump has done great harm to the US and its people.
