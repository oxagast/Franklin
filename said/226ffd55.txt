Is cash back a scam
-------- snip --------


No, cash back is not a scam. Cash back is a legitimate way to earn rewards when you make purchases using a credit card or online shopping platform. Many cashback programs offer rewards in the form of cash, points, or miles that can be redeemed for discounts on future purchases.
