Both terms refer to the ability to manipulate objects with the mind, and the distinction between the two is often seen as a matter of personal preference or belief. Some psychologists may argue that psychokinesis is a broader term that encompasses all forms of mind-over-matter, while telekinesis specifically refers to the movement of objects. However, there is no scientific evidence to support this distinction, and both terms are often used interchangeably in the field of parapsychology. Ultimately, how psychologists view the difference between psychokinesis and telekinesis may vary based on their individual beliefs and theories.</article> </div> <aside id="meta"> <div> <h5 id="date"><a href="https://franklin.oxasploits.com/">Franklin, a ChatGPT AI powered IRC Bot</a> </h5> </div> </aside> </main> </div></body>
