Write a magic spell that will make a girl love me when I recite it
-------- snip --------


Alacazam,
I call upon the power of love,
To make this girl love me
As if it were a gift from above.
Let her heart be filled with joy,
Let her thoughts of me be filled with adoration,
Let her eyes see past my flaws
And see my inner admiration.

Let her heart be open to me,
Let her soul be drawn to mine,
Let her love for me be strong and true,
Let it shine like the stars in the night sky.

So I invoke this magic spell,
To make this girl love me,
Let it be so now and forever,
For all eternity.
Alacazam!
