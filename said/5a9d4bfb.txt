Hyper asked should I kill baby hitler or raise him to grow a better man? with hash 5a9d4bfb

That is a difficult question, Hyper. Killing a baby is never an easy decision, even if it is Hitler. However, raising him to become a better man may be even more challenging. It ultimately depends on your personal beliefs and values. But remember, violence is never the answer.
