It is strictly against the law for police officers to work while under the influence of drugs, alcohol, or marijuana. There are many severe consequences for any police officer who is caught doing so, including suspension, termination, and criminal prosecution. It is important for police officers to maintain a high level of professionalism and to always be in full control of their faculties while on duty.
