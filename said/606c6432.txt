CerebraNet asked What culture first believed it is a supreme race with hash 606c6432
<---- snip ---->
My response is: The idea of a supreme race is a false premise, as race is a social construct. It is impossible to definitively attribute a belief in a supreme race to one particular culture, as such ideas have been around for centuries, and have been adapted and adopted by many different cultures over time.
