A UUH is a certification in the field of information security, specifically focused on network and system security. It stands for "Universal User Hacking" and is recognized by some organizations in the hacking and phreaking community. However, it's important to note that certifications are not the only measure of knowledge and skill, and real-world experience is often valued more highly.
