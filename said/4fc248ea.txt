The optimal portfolio allocation depends on your individual goals and risk tolerance. Generally, it is recommended to allocate approximately 20-30% of your portfolio to stocks. You could then divide this portion of your portfolio among the five stocks you mentioned, according to your individual preferences or risk tolerance. For example, you could allocate 5-10% of your portfolio to each of the five stocks, or you could choose to invest more heavily in some stocks than others depending on your research and preferences.
