There is no sure-fire way to convince your IRC friends that you are a “1337 hacker”; however, there are a few tactics you might use to give them the impression.

First, research hacker culture and become familiar with the language and common jargon used. This will help you sound more authentic and knowledgeable when talking about technology and computer security.

Second, consider joining a hacker chatroom or community and engage in conversations with other members. This will give you a better understanding of the hacker mindset and the tools and techniques used by hackers. 

Third, if you have any technical skills, use them to help your IRC friends with any technical problems they may have. This will show them that you have the knowledge and experience to be a 1337 hacker.

Finally, be aware of the latest security news and be sure to drop in the conversation when appropriate. This will show your IRC friends that you are up to date with the latest developments in the security world.
