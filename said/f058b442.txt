fuzion asked explain kernel level driver attacks with hash f058b442
<---- snip ---->
Kernel level driver attacks are a type of attack that exploit vulnerabilities in the system's kernel-level drivers. These drivers are responsible for controlling hardware devices such as printers, keyboards, and video cards. By exploiting a vulnerability in a kernel-level driver, an attacker can gain access to the system's memory and execute malicious code. This can lead to the attacker gaining full control of the system and the possibility of data theft, denial of service, and other malicious activities.
