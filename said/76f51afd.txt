In California, gift cards are considered prepaid payment instruments and as such are subject to the California Civil Code and the Electronic Funds Transfer Act. Under California Civil Code section 1749.5, gift cards are required to have an expiration date no earlier than five years after the date of issuance. Additionally, gift cards may not contain any fees or expiration dates not disclosed at the time of purchase.
