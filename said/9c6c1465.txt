Sure, I can summarize the conversation from the user aestetix as its relevant to the channel #0xa28. 

In the conversation, aestetix is commenting on a website, Rotten.com, and its featured video which appears to be no longer available and last active in 2012. The video zoomed in on bird feces to the point where individual colors could be distinguished, which was presented as intriguing or attractive content to the site's viewers. 

Let me know if there's anything else I can help you with!
