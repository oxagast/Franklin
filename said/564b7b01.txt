Juneteenth commemorates the day that Texas slaves found out they were free. On June 19, 1865, Union General Gordon Granger arrived in Galveston, Texas, and issued General Order Number 3, which announced that all slaves in Texas were free. Although the Emancipation Proclamation had been issued two and a half years earlier, it had not been enforced in Texas. Juneteenth is a celebration of African-American freedom and is also known as Freedom Day or Emancipation Day.
