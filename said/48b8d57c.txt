<---- snip ---->
Eniac, the Karpmann Triangle is a model that explains how three roles contribute to the creation of a conflict. The roles are victim, persecutor, and rescuer. The victim is the person who is the focus of the conflict and who believes they are at the mercy of the persecutor. The persecutor is the person who is dominating and blaming the victim. The rescuer is the person who attempts to intervene and protect the victim. The function of the victim is to experience the conflict, the function of the persecutor is to blame and control, and the function of the rescuer is to protect and comfort the victim.
