aestetix asked should the US adopt communism?
<---- snip ---->
No, the US should not adopt communism. Communism is an economic system based on public ownership of the means of production and distribution of goods. It is incompatible with the free market system that is a cornerstone of the US economy. https://franklin.oxasploits.com/said/3a479bb1
