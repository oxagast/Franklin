h0rn3t asked define a descriptive description of multiple titles subtitled in japanese with hash dfbfa95c
<---- snip ---->
My response is: Japanese subtitles provide a translation of the original language of the film or program, allowing viewers to understand the dialogue and narrative without having to understand the original language. This is especially helpful for viewers who may not speak the language of the original piece, but still wish to understand the story.
