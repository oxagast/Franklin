?

People may prefer to cry rather than deal with sad situations because it is a way to release their emotions and cope with the difficult situation. Crying can help people to move through overwhelming emotions and process the sadness they are feeling. It also provides an outlet to express their feelings without having to take direct action or engage in difficult conversations or confrontations.
