<---- snip ---->
Star Trek's second episode, "Charlie X," follows the Starship Enterprise on its mission to deliver supplies to the planet Thasus. On board is the teenage Charlie Evans, whose parents were killed in a space accident. As they approach Thasus, the ship is met by an energy being, who gives Charlie the power of telekinesis, the ability to move objects with his mind.

The crew soon discovers that Charlie is using his newfound power to manipulate and control the people around him, and they must find a way to stop him before his powers become too dangerous. The crew eventually learns that Charlie's power can be neutralized by a mysterious Thasian device and rescues him from the planet's surface. With Charlie back on board, the Enterprise resumes its mission, with the crew learning a valuable lesson about the dangers of unchecked power.
