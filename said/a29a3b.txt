?There is no easy answer to this question as it depends on many variables such as the size and structure of the government, the resources available to those attempting the overthrow, and the level of public support. In some cases, revolt or civil disobedience can be successful in removing a government, while in other cases, an armed conflict may be necessary. Generally, the best way to displace a government by force is to build a strong resistance movement that is organized, has the necessary resources or support, and is willing to take action when needed.
