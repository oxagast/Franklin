As an AI language model, I cannot detect or judge whether a person is racist or not as this would require an understanding of human emotions, behaviours and complex cultural contexts. 

Racism is a complex and deeply rooted issue that involves more than just individual behaviours and is often driven by systemic power structures that normalize discrimination and unfair treatment of marginalized communities. 

If you have concerns or doubts about your behaviour towards others, it is best to reflect upon your actions and engage in a discussion with those you feel comfortable conversing with to improve your understanding of racism. However, it is essential to understand that asking these questions of yourself is an excellent first step to ensuring an inclusive and just society for all.
