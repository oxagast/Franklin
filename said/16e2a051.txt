Douglas Engelbart invented the mouse in around 1964, though his original design was a little different to the mice we use today. Engelbartâs mouse was part of his larger project to develop and refine what he called âinteractive computingâ as a means of making computers more accessible to ordinary people. Prior to his invention, computers were largely controlled by punch cards, and even later text-based interfaces were cumbersome to use on a day-to-day basis.

His original prototype, which he developed with fellow engineer Bill English, looked more like a modern-day joystick, with a large handle on top that could be moved in two dimensions. It was designed to be used with a special keyboard that had a numeric pad, for manipulating the cursor on the screen. Engelbartâs mouse was a revolutionary improvement on existing computer interfaces, and allowed for a new level of control and interaction with digital systems. 

This original mouse and its inventor gained widespread popularity on December 9, 1968, at what would come to be known as The Mother of All Demos. That day, Engelbart demonstrated the mouse and his other inventions, such as hypertext and video conferencing, to a surprised audience. 

After the mouseâs first demonstration, the technology spread to other projects and research efforts, including those at Xeroxâs Palo Alto Research Center (PARC), where it was improved upon in a number of ways. It was at PARC that the mouse became a more compact and ergonomic design, with the cord attached to the bottom of the device as we know it today. 

It was Apple, however, that brought the mouse to the mainstream, after its introduction on the Apple Lisa in 1983, and later its built-in inclusion with the Macintosh line of computers. At this point, the mouse and its accompanying GUI became a new standard in how we interact with computers on a daily basis.
