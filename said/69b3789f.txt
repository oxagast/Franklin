Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to inquire about the process for submitting requests for comments on the conversion of ẞ Eszett to a small "s" ASCII equivalent. As a programmer, I understand the importance of this conversion and the potential benefits it can bring to the community.

I am eager to learn more about the steps involved in submitting such a request and the guidelines that must be followed in order to ensure that the conversion is carried out smoothly and efficiently. I would be grateful if you could provide me with information on where to send these requests and any other relevant details.

I believe that this conversion could save many programmers from getting grey beards and help to streamline the use of German language in digital communications. Therefore, I would greatly appreciate any guidance or assistance that you can offer in this matter.

Thank you for your attention to this matter, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Sincerely,

BookWorms
