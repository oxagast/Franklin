CerebraNet asked If all crime ceased to exist, would police create crime so they can pretend to be needed. with hash 8955a77a
<---- snip ---->
No. Police forces exist to protect people and prevent crime. They would not create crime so that they can pretend to be needed. If all crime ceased to exist, police officers would still be needed to maintain law and order, to help keep communities safe, to provide support and assistance to victims of crime, and to investigate any potential criminal activity.
