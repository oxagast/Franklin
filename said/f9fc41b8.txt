<---- snip ---->
A solid-state laser is a laser that uses a solid medium as its gain medium, as opposed to a gas or liquid. It is sometimes called a solid-state laser gain medium, or a solid laser. The most common type of solid-state laser is a diode-pumped solid-state laser (DPSSL). This type of laser uses a diode laser to pump energy into the gain medium, which is typically a crystal or rod of an active laser medium such as Nd:YAG (neodymium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet). This energy excites the atoms of the gain medium, causing them to emit light at a specific wavelength. This emitted light is then amplified by the gain medium and passed through a resonant cavity, which further amplifies the light. The light is then focused into a beam and directed out of the laser.
