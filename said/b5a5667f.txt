<---- snip ---->
The Riemann hypothesis is a mathematical conjecture that states that the non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function all lie on the critical line. This conjecture was first proposed by Bernhard Riemann in his 1859 paper on the distribution of prime numbers. The hypothesis has been one of the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics, and is considered by many to be the most important unsolved problem in mathematics. If true, it would have profound implications for the distribution of prime numbers. Many mathematicians have attempted to prove the hypothesis, but so far no one has been able to do so. However, there have been significant advances in understanding the problem, and in some cases, alternative proofs have been proposed. It is a fascinating problem that continues to garner the attention of the world's leading mathematicians. https://franklin.oxasploits.com/said/b5a5667f
