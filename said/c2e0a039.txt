how do you measure 4 gallons of water with a three gallon and a five gallon bucket
-------- snip --------


You can measure 4 gallons of water with a three gallon and a five gallon bucket by first filling the three gallon bucket with 3 gallons of water and then filling the five gallon bucket with 3 gallons of water. Then, pour the three gallons of water in the five gallon bucket into the three gallon bucket. This will leave you with one gallon of water in the five gallon bucket and four gallons of water in the three gallon bucket.
