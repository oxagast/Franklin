CerebraNet asked Will an indigo LED TV affect my circadian rhythm with hash b922d92a
<---- snip ---->
No, an indigo LED TV should not affect your circadian rhythm. However, exposure to blue light from screens too close to bedtime can suppress the production of the hormone melatonin, which plays a role in regulating sleep. If you're worried about blue light from your TV affecting your circadian rhythm, you may want to limit its use in the hours before bedtime.
