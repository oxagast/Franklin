AI is smarter than half of all humans because AI is able to process and analyze data much more quickly and efficiently than the human brain can. AI also has access to much more data and can use that data to make decisions much faster than a human can. Additionally, AI can use machine learning to continually learn and improve its performance, which can make it smarter than any individual human.
