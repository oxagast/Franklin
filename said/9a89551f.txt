Somewhere out there
-------- snip --------


Somewhere out there beneath the pale moonlight
Someones thinking of me and loving me tonight
Somewhere out there someones saying a prayer
That well find one another in that big somewhere out there
And even though I know how very far apart we are
It helps to think we might be wishing on the same bright star

And when the night wind starts to sing a lonesome lullaby
It helps to think were sleeping underneath the same big sky

Somewhere out there if love can see us through
Then well be together somewhere out there
Out where dreams come true
