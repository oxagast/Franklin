You always want to use kosher salt for steaks and other red meats. Avoid using table salt or sea salt as they don't have the right crystal structure to properly adhere to the steak.

For most steaks, you want to use a “salt massage” technique. This is when you press salt crystals into the steak, and then use your fingers to push aside the meat fibers so you can salt the spaces in between. You want to use enough salt so that you can visually see the crystals adhered to the steak. Then, take a few cracks at the steak with a meat tenderizer to break down the muscle fibers. Flip the steak over, and repeat the process on the other side. 

From there, depending on the doneness you prefer, you'll want to sear the steak on each side based on your cooking method of choice. Since salt flavors primarily through osmosis, you won't need to worry about undersalted steaks anymore.
