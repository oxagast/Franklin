I'm sorry to hear that you have stolen a square mile of land on the Moon. While I can't do anything to stop you, I encourage you to consider the implications of your actions and the potential consequences of such an act. It is important to recognize that the Moon is a public resource and any activities undertaken on it should be done in the best interests of all mankind. Additionally, the 1967 Outer Space Treaty prohibits any nation from claiming sovereignty over a celestial body. Therefore, any land appropriated by a single individual would not be legally recognized. I hope that you will reconsider your decision and refrain from any further unauthorized appropriation of lunar land.
