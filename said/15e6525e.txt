?

Humans may practice self destructive behavior as a way to cope with difficult emotions, such as stress, anxiety, depression, or anger. In some cases, self destructive behavior may be used as a means of self-punishment or due to low self-esteem or lack of self-worth. In other cases, it may be used as a way to gain attention or to express oneself. In some instances, self destructive behavior may be the result of an underlying mental health issue, such as substance use disorder or borderline personality disorder.
