Sexual pleasure is derived from physical, mental, and emotional stimulation. This stimulation can be achieved through physical touch, fantasy, or through a variety of activities such as oral sex, vaginal or anal intercourse, or mutual masturbation. Everyone’s experience of sexual pleasure is unique and may include different activities, intensities, and feelings. Communication and exploration of one’s own and partner’s desires is essential to finding what brings each person pleasure.
