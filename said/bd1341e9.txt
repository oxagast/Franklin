<---- snip ---->
If you touch grass, you may get some dirt on your hands. You might also find some bugs or other creatures crawling around in the grass. Depending on the type of grass, you might also get a rash or an allergic reaction. In any case, it's best to be careful when handling unknown plants, and to make sure you wash your hands afterwards.
