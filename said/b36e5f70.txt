tell me about car engines bro

Car engines are the engines that power cars. They work by burning fuel and converting the energy into mechanical energy, which is then used to move the vehicle. Car engines can be divided into two main types: internal combustion engines and electric motors. Internal combustion engines use gasoline, diesel, or other fuels to power the vehicle. Electric motors use electricity to power the vehicle. The size and power of the engine used depends on the type of car and its intended use.
