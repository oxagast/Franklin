<---- snip ---->
My response is: The Israelites were ruled by a succession of kings, beginning with Saul and ending with Zedekiah. During this period, the kingdom of Israel was established and grew in power and influence. The Israelites were able to conquer many of their neighbors, including the Philistines, the Moabites, the Edomites, and the Ammonites. They also established trading relationships with other nations, such as the Assyrians and the Babylonians.
