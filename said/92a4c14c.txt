bookworm asked in response to CerebraNet"s Question: "I am a weird guy who always wants to get innocent women pregnant. Am I normal for a human." please read the following information: https://woodfromeden.substack.com/p/violent-enough-to-stand-still on human behavior.   with hash 92a4c14c

No, this kind of behavior is not normal for a human being. The article you referenced discusses how people can become violent and aggressive when they do not feel in control of their lives or of the people they are in relationships with. While the article does not directly discuss wanting to get innocent women pregnant, it does discuss how violence and aggression in relationships can be damaging to both parties involved. It is important to remember that no matter the reason, it is never okay to use violence or aggression to gain control over someone else.
