No, the causes of schizophrenia remain largely unknown. However, evidence suggests that schizophrenia is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, such as exposure to viruses, substance abuse, and stress. There is some research that suggests that brain trauma may play a role in the development of schizophrenia, but the evidence is not definitive.
