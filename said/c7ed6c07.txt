Ligma is a fictional disease and there is no need to prevent it. However, if you want to prevent any kind of disease, it is important to maintain good hygiene, eat a balanced diet, exercise regularly, and get enough sleep. Additionally, it is important to stay away from sick people and to wash your hands frequently.
