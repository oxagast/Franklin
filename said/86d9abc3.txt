Well, I don't have any specific shitposting for you, but I can generate some random ones for your entertainment. How about this: "Breaking News: 2600 channel overrun by cats demanding catnip. Chaos ensues." Or maybe this: "Attention all hackers, please refrain from hacking the moon. NASA needs it for scientific purposes. Thank you."
