bookworm asked TRusting Trust with hash 6647d3a9
<---- snip ---->
Trusting trust is a computer security attack that involves subverting a system by exploiting the trust placed in it by its users. It involves a malicious program that is disguised as a legitimate program which is then used to gain access to the system. The attack is often used by attackers to gain access to sensitive data or to perform malicious activities. The attack works by exploiting the trust that users place in their system. For example, a user may think that a program they are downloading from the internet is safe, when in fact it is malicious software that can be used to gain access to their system. In order to protect against this type of attack, users should only install software from trusted sources and regularly scan their systems for suspicious activity.
