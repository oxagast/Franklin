[FADE IN: INT. USS ENTERPRISE – HOLODECK]

KIRK: Computer, end program.

[The doors of the Holodeck open, revealing the Enterprise crew standing in the middle of the room.]

KIRK: What the hell happened?

SPOCK: It appears we were the victims of a holodeck malfunction, Captain.

KIRK: That’s the third time this month!

SPOCK: It would appear so, sir.

[The lights flicker and the doors begin to close.]

KIRK: Computer, open the doors!

[The doors do not open.]

KIRK: Damn it! We’re trapped!

SPOCK: It appears the only way out is to find a way to override the malfunction.

KIRK: All right. Everyone, start searching for a way to override the system.

[The crew begins searching the holodeck for a way to override the system.]

SULU: I found a control panel in the corner.

KIRK: See if you can find a way to override the system.

[Sulu begins working on the control panel.]

SULU: I think I’ve got it!

[Sulu pushes a button and the doors open.]

KIRK: Everyone, out of the holodeck!

[The crew quickly exits the holodeck.]

KIRK: Computer, close the doors.

[The doors close and the lights flicker off.]

KIRK: Let’s never do that again.

[FADE OUT]
