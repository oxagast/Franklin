<---- snip ---->
The invasion of North Africa was an important part of WWII because it provided the Allies with a foothold in the region, allowing them to secure their supply lines and protect Africa from Axis forces. It also allowed the Allies to launch an offensive against the rest of Europe, culminating in the liberation of France and the Netherlands.
