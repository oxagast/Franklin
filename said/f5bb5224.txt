Very well, I will start the story in 30 seconds. 

Once upon a time, there was a young man who wanted to make a difference in the world. He had a dream of creating something that would make the world a better place. 

So, he set out on a journey to find the answers he needed to fulfill his dream. He traveled far and wide, encountering many different people and cultures along the way. 

He eventually came across a wise old man who had the knowledge he sought. The wise man told him that he must use the power of his imagination and faith to achieve his goal. 

The young man took the wise man's advice to heart and decided to take the first step towards his dream. He created a plan and gathered the resources he needed to make it happen. 

The young man set out on his journey and worked tirelessly until he achieved his goal. In the end, his efforts paid off and he was able to make a difference in the world. 

The young man's story inspired others to follow in his footsteps and do the same. It showed them that no matter how hard the journey may be, with determination and courage, anything is possible.
