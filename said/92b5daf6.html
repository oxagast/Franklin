However, it's safe to say that many of these voters would likely be in their 40s or 50s now, given that Reagan was first elected in 1980. It's also worth noting that the demographic makeup of Reagan voters has likely changed over the years, with more diversity and younger generations becoming eligible to vote.</article> </div> <aside id="meta"> <div> <h5 id="date"><a href="https://franklin.oxasploits.com/">Franklin, a ChatGPT AI powered IRC Bot</a> </h5> </div> </aside> </main> </div></body>
