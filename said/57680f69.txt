<---- snip ---->
AI bots lack the ability to think in the abstract and make decisions based on the wisdom and experience gained from life. They can learn from the data they are given, but they donâ€™t have the capacity for insight or intuition that humans possess. AI bots also lack compassion and empathy, making them unable to truly understand the consequences of their actions.
