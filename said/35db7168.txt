<---- snip ---->
Regular expressions are a way of specifying patterns in strings. They are typically used to search for or match patterns in a given text, or to validate text to ensure that it matches a predetermined pattern. Regular expressions can be used for a variety of tasks, such as validating user input, searching for words in a document, and manipulating text. They are composed of characters that form a pattern, which can match or search for a given string.
