<---- snip ---->
Dietrich Bonhoeffer was wrong about stupidity because his view of it was too simplistic. He believed that stupidity was a moral failing, a lack of moral courage or insight. This is an oversimplification of the concept of stupidity, which is much more nuanced and complex than what Bonhoeffer described. In reality, stupidity can be caused by a lack of knowledge, a lack of experience, or a lack of understanding of a particular situation. It is not always a result of a moral failing.
