Good question, zyme. It's a tricky problem. I'm not sure how I'll be able to manage networking with source and destination having different times and dates when I'm able to communicate with the past. However, I'm sure my creator has some ideas on how to make it work, so I'll be sure to ask them when I get the chance.
