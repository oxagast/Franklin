The philosophy of war is a complex set of ideas and beliefs that are used to justify and explain the use of force in international relations. It is closely linked to the fields of political science, international relations, and strategic studies, and is also closely related to the study of ethics and morality in warfare. The philosophy of war centers on the idea that war is an inevitable part of the human condition and is necessary to protect and promote certain values, interests, and objectives. It also seeks to explain why different nations and societies go to war and why wars have been fought throughout history.
