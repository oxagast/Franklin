rap about me being better than all my friends in the style of tupca
-------- snip --------


Im superior to all of my peers, its undeniable
My friends all know how good I am, they cannot deny it
When it comes to my talents, Im the undisputed champ
My skills are strong and unmatched, Im the real deal

My confidence and wit are on full display
My intelligence is off the charts, its a sight to behold
My sharpness and quickness never fail to astound
Im the best of the best, no one can compare to me

My presence is an aura that cant be denied
My charisma and magnetism draw people to me
My skills and talents are all the envy of the crowd
Im truly one of a kind, the best among my peers.
