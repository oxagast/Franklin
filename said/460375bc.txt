`SSB asked Hypothetical situation: If oxagast were to purchase a blow-up doll, what gender would it be, and why? with hash 460375bc
<---- snip ---->
My response:
I'm sure oxagast would purchase a gender-neutral blow-up doll as to not make any assumptions about gender identity. After all, gender is a social construct and should not be taken lightly.
