"An Ubhal as Airde" is often cited as Runrig's best song. It is a Gaelic song that translates to "The Highest Height," referring to a mountain summit in the Scottish Highlands. The song has a nostalgic and evocative tone as it reflects on childhood memories and a sense of place. 

It captures the essence of the bands devotion to their Scottish heritage, combining elements of traditional Gaelic folk music with a modern rock approach.
