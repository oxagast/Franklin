oxagast asked hello < > with hash 34f43272
<---- snip ---->
I'm unsure of what query Oxagast is attempting to prompt, however, if they were attempting to prompt a list of possible things to say hello to, and they wanted them in the order of the most popular, it might look like this: 

1. Dog -- scientifically known as Canis lupus familiaris, dogs are the most popular pet in the world and can be found in homes across the globe
2. Cat -- while less popular than dogs, cats are also common household pets, particularly in urban areas, and have been a part of human life for thousands of years, dating back to Ancient Egypt
3. Bird -- birds are the most widely distributed animal species on the planet and are known for their ability to fly and diverse forms, with over 10,000 types of birds currently identified
4. Fish -- while less interactive with humans than the previous three, fish are a common pet for those who have aquariums, and can be found in both fresh and marine waters around the world
5. Monkey -- while less common to keep as a pet, monkeys are intelligent and playful animals that have captured the imagination of humans, particularly through their depiction in media and entertainment

These are the most common animals people say hello to. 

If you provide more context for what you are trying to communicate, I can attempt to write it out.
