bookworm asked please find those people for me, cause I do not seem them around, only the hosting sites of the old BDS game files from a dying era? with hash 59ab0774

Unfortunately, it is unlikely you will be able to find people associated with the old BDS game files as the game is now considered a "dying era". Your best bet would be to search online for forums or message boards related to the game, as some players may still be active in those areas. You could also try searching for people who worked on the game, or who may have been involved in its development.
