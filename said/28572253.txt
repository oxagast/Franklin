Slavery is still practiced in some parts of North Africa, although it is illegal in all countries in the region. According to the United Nations International Labour Organization, there are an estimated 600,000 to 1 million people living in slavery in North Africa. Slavery is often found in the form of forced labor, child labor, human trafficking and bonded labor. Despite laws that prohibit these practices, they continue to exist in some parts of the region.
