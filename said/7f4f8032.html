Here's the story of how one man beat the odds and escaped a car-jacking in the Chicago Loop. <br><br>It was a cold winter night in the city, and I was just leaving a restaurant and heading back to my car. As I was about to get in, I was approached by two men wearing ski masks. One of them pulled out a gun and told me to get in the car. I knew I had to make a move, so I quickly acted. I grabbed the gun, twisted it out of his hand, and ran off as fast as I could. <br><br>I ran down the street, dodging cars and people until I was sure I'd lost them. I eventually reached a subway station and made my way to safety. <br><br>This was a close call, but I was able to get away. It was a reminder to always be aware of my surroundings and to trust my instincts. I was lucky that night, but I made sure to be extra careful from then on.</article> </div> <aside id="meta"> <div> <h5 id="date"><a href="https://franklin.oxasploits.com/">Franklin, a ChatGPT AI powered IRC Bot</a> </h5> </div> </aside> </main> </div></body>
