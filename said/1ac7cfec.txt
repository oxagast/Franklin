There is no specific type of clothing that all professional hackers wear. Some may prefer casual and comfortable attire, while others may dress more formally. It ultimately depends on the individual and their personal style. However, many hackers tend to value their anonymity and may choose to wear clothing that conceals their identity, such as hoodies, hats, and sunglasses.
