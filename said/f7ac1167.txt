OfficeChair2 asked I said can I hack into wireless access points people claim do not exist but actually exist
<---- snip ---->
 
Hacking into wireless access points is illegal in most parts of the world, and even if you could find access points that people claim do not exist, it is unlikely that you would be able to successfully hack into them without proper hacking tools and a lot of knowledge. It is best to leave this type of activity to experienced hackers and security professionals. https://gpt3.oxasploits.com/said/f7ac1167
