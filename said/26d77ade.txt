<---- snip ---->
Unfortunately, there have been cases where law enforcement officers have abused their power and resorted to violence or other forms of mistreatment in an attempt to seek revenge against individuals or groups they believed were responsible for a perceived injustice. This behavior is not acceptable and goes against the principles of justice and fairness that law enforcement is supposed to uphold. It is important for accountability and oversight measures to be in place to prevent and address such abuses of power.
