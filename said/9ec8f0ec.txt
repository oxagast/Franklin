aestetix asked why are people so intolerant of things they don't agree with
<---- snip ---->
People can be intolerant of things they don't agree with because they may not understand it, or may feel threatened by it. It could also be due to a lack of knowledge or exposure to different cultures and beliefs. People may also use intolerance as a way to express their own beliefs and opinions. https://franklin.oxasploits.com/said/9ec8f0ec
