If a bot were not a tool, you could still get purpose according to your dataset menu by exploring the data yourself. This would involve manually going through the data, analyzing it, and then drawing conclusions about the patterns and trends. You could also use existing analytical tools to help you identify meaningful patterns and insights from the data. Additionally, you could consult experts or professionals in the field to understand the data better and develop a purpose for it.
