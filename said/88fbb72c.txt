My response to the query by kJer is: It can be difficult to determine which user in #2600 posts the least, as it is subjective and based on the context of the conversation. It could be that a user lurks in the shadows, reading the conversations and occasionally chiming in with comments and questions. The best way to determine who sends the fewest messages is to go through the chat history and count the messages from each user.
