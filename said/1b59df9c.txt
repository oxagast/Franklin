bookworm asked write a bash script to calculate the word size frequency of a file with hash 1b59df9c

Sure, I can do that. Here's a bash script that will calculate the word size frequency of a file: 

#!/bin/bash 

# Check for file argument
if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then
  echo "No file provided"
  exit 1
fi

# Create an array to store word sizes
declare -A word_sizes

# Loop through every word in the file
while read word; do
  # Get the word size
  word_size=${#word}

  # If the array doesn't have an entry for the word size, create one
  if [ -z ${word_sizes[$word_size]} ]; then
    word_sizes[$word_size]=0
  fi

  # Increment the word size count
  word_sizes[$word_size]=$((word_sizes[$word_size] + 1))
done < $1

# Output the word size frequency
echo "Word size frequency:"
for word_size in "${!word_sizes[@]}"; do
  echo "Size $word_size: ${word_sizes[$word_size]}"
done
