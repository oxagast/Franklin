CerebraNet asked What might life be like if multiple gods existed with hash 66ab8b5d
<---- snip ---->
If multiple gods existed, life could be unpredictable. People could be pulled in different directions depending on which god they believed in. Wars could be fought over which god was the right one, and it could be hard to decide what was right and wrong. People might also have different expectations of how to live their lives based on which god they believed in. Ultimately, life could be chaotic and confusing.
