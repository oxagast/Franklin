<---- snip ---->
 
No one can answer this question definitively, as this is a spiritual matter. In some religious contexts, it is believed that a person who has committed a sin will go to Hell, while in other contexts, it is believed that all people will eventually be forgiven and welcomed into heaven. https://gpt3.oxasploits.com/said/1f0b3ff5
