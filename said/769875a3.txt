<---- snip ---->
A Network Operations Center (NOC) is a centralized location that is responsible for monitoring, managing, and troubleshooting a network of computers and other devices. The NOC is responsible for ensuring that the network is up and running at all times, and for addressing any issues that arise. It is typically responsible for monitoring the network for performance issues and security threats, and for responding to any problems that arise. The NOC is also responsible for managing and maintaining network infrastructure, such as routers and switches, and for performing routine maintenance tasks.
