what is your favorite part of the movie Terminator 2
-------- snip --------


My favorite part of Terminator 2 is when Sarah Connor is able to confront the T-1000 and use her strength and wit to defeat him. The scene is epic and really showcases the strength and courage of Sarah Connor. Its a great reminder that even in the face of overwhelming odds, one can still find the courage to stand up and fight against all odds.
