Difference between belief and blind faith
-------- snip --------


Belief is based on evidence, research, or personal experience, whereas blind faith is based on trust without any evidence or logical reasoning. Belief can lead to the development of understanding, whereas blind faith can remain a mystery. Belief can be shared and discussed, while blind faith is more personal and not necessarily discussed openly.
