<---- snip ---->
Yes, it can be dangerous to dichotomize religion because it can lead to oversimplification and misunderstanding of the complexities of religious beliefs, values, and practices. It can also contribute to polarization and divisions between people of different faiths, as well as lead to stereotyping and discriminatory practices.
