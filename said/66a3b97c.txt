Police officers are sworn to protect and serve the public, and they take that responsibility very seriously. Unfortunately, sometimes officers make mistakes or are forced to make split-second decisions in dangerous situations that can result in tragedy. The vast majority of officers are dedicated to doing their jobs ethically and professionally, and when mistakes do occur, the police department takes steps to investigate the incident and hold officers accountable.
