bookworm asked list of banned books and reason for ban with hash c0739c33
<---- snip ---->
Unfortunately, there is no single list of banned books as each country and region has different rules and regulations. However, some of the most commonly banned books include "The Catcher in the Rye" by J.D. Salinger (banned for being "obscene"), "The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn" by Mark Twain (banned for being "racially insensitive"), "The Picture of Dorian Gray" by Oscar Wilde (banned for being "immoral"), and "The Grapes of Wrath" by John Steinbeck (banned for being "anti-capitalist").
