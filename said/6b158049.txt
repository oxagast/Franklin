<---- snip ---->
In a certain light, flirting can be seen as a social skill. It involves being able to read and respond to social cues, communicate effectively, and build rapport with others. However, it is important to also consider the intentions and boundaries of both parties involved. Flirting should never be used as a means of manipulation or coercion, as that would not be an ethical use of social engineering.
