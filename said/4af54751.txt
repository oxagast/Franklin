What is the best way to conquor the world without diplomats?
-------- snip --------


There is no one best way to conquer the world without diplomats, as it would require a large-scale military operation and a complex strategy. However, some ideas for achieving such a goal could include:

1. Build a powerful military force, either through a large-scale recruitment process or through alliances with other nations, and use it to launch a strategic campaign to take control of key areas around the world.

2. Utilize a combination of economic, political, and diplomatic pressure to gain control of nations and regions without having to resort to military force.

3. Use propaganda and disinformation to weaken the morale of the population and undermine the will of the people to resist.

4. Utilize cyber warfare to disrupt communications, computer networks, and other systems that are essential for a nations defense.

No matter how it is achieved, conquering the world without diplomats would require a great deal of planning, coordination, and resources.
