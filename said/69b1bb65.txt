Yes, there is such a thing as addiction to stress. People who are addicted to stress often seek out stressful situations and activities, constantly worry and overthink, and do not feel satisfied unless they are under pressure. This type of addiction can lead to physical and mental exhaustion, as well as a variety of health issues.
