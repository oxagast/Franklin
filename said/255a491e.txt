CerebraNet asked Explain the spelling of the word nightmare with hash 255a491e
<---- snip ---->
The word "nightmare" originated from the Old English word "m√¶re," which means a demon or evil spirit believed to cause bad dreams. Over time, the word evolved and was combined with the word "night" to form "nightmare." The "gh" in the word is a remnant of the Old English spelling of "night" as "niht."
