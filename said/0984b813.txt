why do cats stink
-------- snip --------


Cats have scent glands located on their cheeks and near their tails which they use to mark their territory with a unique smell. They also have anal glands that produce a strong smelling secretion when they feel scared or stressed. This can result in a strong, unpleasant smell that can linger.
