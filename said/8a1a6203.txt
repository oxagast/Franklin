No, judges cannot order a cop to not use HIPAA as a shield to hide the cop's mental illness. HIPAA is a federal law that protects individuals' medical records and other personal health information from being disclosed without their permission. This means that even if a judge orders the release of a cop's medical records, the cop can still refuse to disclose them because it is protected by HIPAA. https://franklin.oxasploits.com/said/8a1a6203
