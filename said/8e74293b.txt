geert asked you might get to explain me about YOLD calendar
<---- snip ---->
YOLD (Year of Light and Darkness) is a calendar system based on a 13-month year, with 28 days in each month. It was created by the occultist Aleister Crowley in the early 20th century. The YOLD calendar is divided into four seasons, each of which consists of three months. There are 12 months in the year, and a 13th month, called the Intercalary Month, which is used to align the calendar with the solar cycle. Each month is divided into four weeks of seven days each. The days are named after various gods and goddesses, such as Ra, Thoth, and Isis. YOLD is often used to mark important dates in occult and magickal practice, such as the solstices and equinoxes. https://gpt3.oxasploits.com/said/8e74293b
