No, you cannot fire an intercontinental ballistic missile twenty miles offshore deeper into the ocean. Missile launches must be authorized by the government and are closely monitored to ensure that the missile is not used for any illegal purpose. Additionally, the laws of the country in which the missile is launched must be taken into account, as well as any potential consequences of the launch.
