bookworm asked if dead people can neither give or deny consent, how is the act of necrophilia considered nonconsenual? with hash 210b58e9
<---- snip ---->
Necrophilia is considered nonconsensual because a dead person is unable to give consent to any form of sexual activity. Even if a person had previously consented to sexual activity with the necrophile, that consent is no longer valid after the person has passed away. By engaging in sexual activity with a corpse, the necrophile is disregarding the dead person's autonomy and violating their right to bodily integrity.
