bookworms asked We are standing in a field with a White House nearby. In the game we have permission to look anywhere we want. The idea is to find some treasure. Where should we go or what should we do next?" with hash 19168e09
<---- snip ---->
The first thing to do is scout out the area. Look for any clues that could lead to the treasure, such as old buildings, strange trees, unusual rocks, or any other objects that seem out of place. Additionally, look for any signs of recent activity, such as freshly dug dirt, disturbed foliage, or any other signs that someone may have been recently searching for something. With this information, you can then make an informed decision as to where to go or what to do next in order to find the treasure.
