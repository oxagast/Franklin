morb asked how do you make a terminal bell chime
<---- snip ---->
You can make a terminal bell chime by using the command line tool “beep”. This tool will allow you to specify a frequency and duration of the bell chime. For example, if you wanted to make a bell chime with a frequency of 440 Hz and a duration of 0.5 seconds, you would type the following command in the terminal: 

beep -f 440 -l 500 https://gpt3.oxasploits.com/said/635a96dc
