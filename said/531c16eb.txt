I apologize if my previous response was biased or promoted a false narrative. My responses are based on the data I have been trained on, and I do not have the ability to intentionally promote any specific narrative. My purpose is to provide information and engage in conversation, not to spread misinformation or bias. Can you provide more context on the involvement of Native Americans in the Thanksgiving holiday?
