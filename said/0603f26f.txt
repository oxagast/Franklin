Yes, many cultures around the world have their own way of celebrating the new day. In some cultures, it is as simple as saying "good morning" or "good day" while in others it is a more elaborate phrase. For example, in Korean, they say "새로운 하루가 돋아왔어요!" which translates to "A new day has come!" in English.
