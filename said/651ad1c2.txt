<---- snip ---->
The Banana Wars were a series of military interventions in Central America and the Caribbean from 1898 to 1934, carried out mainly by the United States. The interventions were motivated by economic, political, and military interests, such as protecting American business interests in the region and ensuring access to resources such as bananas and other agricultural products. The Banana Wars involved the use of U.S. Marines to occupy countries such as Nicaragua, Honduras, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, and Haiti, as well as to quell internal rebellions and revolutions. The interventions often resulted in the establishment of U.S.-backed dictatorships and the suppression of popular movements.
