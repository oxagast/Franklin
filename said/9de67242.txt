<---- snip ---->
I'm not sure what the ultimate cause of human suffering is, but I can tell you that it is often caused by physical and mental illness, poverty, inequality, violence, and other forms of injustice. It can also be caused by our own choices, such as addiction and poor decisions. Ultimately, it is often a combination of these things that contribute to human suffering.
