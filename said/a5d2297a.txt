bookworm asked how is happiness regulated in human biology? with hash a5d2297a
<---- snip ---->
Happiness is regulated in the human body by a range of different hormones, neurotransmitters and brain regions. The hormones serotonin, dopamine and oxytocin are known to be involved in regulating happiness, as well as the brain regions such as the prefrontal cortex, amygdala, hippocampus and nucleus accumbens. Neurotransmitters such as endorphins, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate also play a role in regulating happiness. Stress hormones like cortisol can have an effect on happiness, as can lifestyle factors such as diet, exercise and sleep.
