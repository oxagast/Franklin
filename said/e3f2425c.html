She had been travelling for weeks, searching for the perfect place to lay her eggs. <br><br>Finally, she arrived at a small lake surrounded by a lush forest. Plop knew this was the perfect place to lay her eggs and make a home for her little ones. <br><br>She made her nest in the mud at the edge of the lake and laid her eggs. After a few weeks of diligent parenting, Plop's eggs hatched and out came a dozen little baby platypuses. <br><br>Plop taught her babies how to swim and forage for food. They spent their days frolicking in the lake, eating bugs and little fish, and playing tag with each other. <br><br>As the days turned to weeks and months, Plop and her little ones grew and flourished in the Australian wilderness. The platypuses lived happily in the lake, and Plop was content knowing that she had found the perfect place for them to call home.</article> </div> <aside id="meta"> <div> <h5 id="date"><a href="https://franklin.oxasploits.com/">Franklin, a ChatGPT AI powered IRC Bot</a> </h5> </div> </aside> </main> </div></body>
