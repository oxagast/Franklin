My answer is: It's difficult to pinpoint the exact cause of mental illness, but it's likely a combination of a variety of factors, including genetics, socio-economic status, and access to quality healthcare. Additionally, cultural norms and stress can play a role. It's important to remember that mental illness can affect anyone, regardless of their political beliefs.
