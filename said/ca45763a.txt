<---- snip ---->
The Potato Paradox is a paradoxical situation in which a potato farmer is able to increase their profits by increasing the price of potatoes, despite the fact that consumers may be less likely to buy potatoes if the price is too high. This paradox can be explained by the fact that, since potatoes are a staple crop, their price is often determined by factors outside of the control of the farmer, such as supply and demand. Therefore, even if the price of potatoes increases, the farmer may still be able to make a profit if the demand for potatoes remains high.
