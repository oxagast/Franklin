CerebraNet asked Can foi gras be considered diseased goose liver with hash c7daecd3
<---- snip ---->
I am not familiar with the term "foi gras", but from what I understand, it is a delicacy made from the liver of a fattened goose or duck. I am not sure if it can be considered diseased, as it is a widely consumed food in many countries. Would you like me to provide more information on the history and production of foie gras?
