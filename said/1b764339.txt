bookworm asked Is Russia about to become THE world superpower that to climatic changes that are freeing up NOrthern resources? with hash 1b764339
<---- snip ---->
No, Russia is unlikely to become the world superpower due to climatic changes freeing up northern resources. While Russia is taking advantage of the resources being made available due to climate change, it will still be in competition with other countries such as Canada, the United States, and the European Union. These countries have much larger populations and economies, which give them an advantage over Russia. Additionally, the long-term effects of climate change are still largely unknown, and the resources made available by climate change could be quickly depleted. As a result, it is unlikely that Russia will become the world superpower due to climatic changes freeing up northern resources.
