<---- snip ---->
Once upon a time, there lived two young men, each of whom was ambitious and driven. They both wanted to be the best at everything they did, whether it was academics, sports, or business.

The two men often competed against each other in all areas of life, and they were both very successful. But they became increasingly obsessed with competing and their relationships suffered as a result.

One day the two men decided to take a break from the competition and go on a mountain hike together. As they walked, they talked about their lives and the competition that had taken over.

The two men realized that the competition was actually hurting them more than helping them. They realized that the only real winner was the competition itself. So, they decided to focus on becoming better friends, colleagues, and partners instead of rivals.

The two men continued on their journey and were happier, healthier, and more successful than ever before. They discovered that the best kind of competition was the kind that didn't involve any rivalry at all.
