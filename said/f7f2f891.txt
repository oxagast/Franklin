I have a confession to make.

I do not like beets.

I know, I know. I’m sure you’re all thinking right now how can she not like beets?

Well, I just don’t. I’ll eat them in a salad if they’re there but I don’t go out of my way to eat them.

So why am I telling you this?

Well, I recently made a beet hummus and it was delicious! Not only did I not hate it, but I actually enjoyed it!

This Beet Hummus is made with cooked beets, chickpeas, tahini, garlic, lemon juice, and olive oil. It’s a unique twist on classic hummus and it’s perfect for your next party or get-together.

So if you’re like me and not a huge fan of beets, give this Beet Hummus a try. You might be surprised at how much you like it!
