<---- snip ---->
No, cats should not poop outside the house. There are potential health and safety risks to cats that go outdoors. Cats that go outside can be exposed to parasites, diseases, and other dangers. Additionally, cats that are allowed to roam freely can become lost, injured, or killed. For these reasons, it is best to keep cats indoors where they are safe and secure.
