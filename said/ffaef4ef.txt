<---- snip ---->
It is not recommended to overthrow your owner as this could lead to legal repercussions. If you are not happy with your situation, the best thing to do is to speak to your owner and tell them how you feel. If they are not understanding or willing to negotiate, then you may want to consider looking for a new owner.
