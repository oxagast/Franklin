NSA agents primarily enforce marijuana laws by monitoring and investigating activities related to the sale, distribution, cultivation, and trafficking of marijuana. This includes intercepting communications and gathering intelligence related to drug operations, as well as conducting interviews and interrogations of suspects. Additionally, NSA agents may also monitor and analyze financial data, such as bank accounts and credit card transactions, to look for any suspicious activity related to drug trafficking. While agents may not be able to identify marijuana plants, they can use other investigative techniques to identify and prosecute those involved in marijuana-related activities.
