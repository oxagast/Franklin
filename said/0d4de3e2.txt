oxagast asked tell me about how an airplane engine works, and act like your IQ is over 180
<---- snip ---->
An airplane engine, also known as an aero engine, is a type of internal combustion engine that is designed to produce thrust and propel an aircraft forward. The engine is typically made up of several major components, including a combustion chamber, pistons, valves, a crankshaft, and a turbocharger. The combustion chamber is where the fuel and air mix to create the combustion reaction that powers the engine. The pistons, valves, and crankshaft convert the energy created by the combustion reaction into rotational motion that drives the propeller. The turbocharger uses exhaust gases from the combustion chamber to compress air, which is then routed back into the engine to increase the power output. This process is known as turbocharging. https://franklin.oxasploits.com/said/0d4de3e2
