bookworm asked explain how GNU parallel works? with hash 89b98d12
<---- snip ---->
GNU Parallel is a command-line utility that allows a user to execute multiple jobs in parallel. It works by taking a command (or set of commands) and running them simultaneously across multiple processors or computers. It can also be used to take a file or set of files and split the data across multiple processors or computers for faster processing. The user can control the number of jobs that can be run in parallel and the number of processors or computers that are utilized. GNU Parallel also has a variety of options for customizing the execution of parallel jobs, such as setting the number of jobs to be run at a given time, setting resource limits, and changing the order in which jobs are executed.
