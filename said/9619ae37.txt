🐦One Who Flew over the Coo coo's Nest🐦

Once upon a time, there was a bird who was brave and daring. He wanted to fly higher than any other bird. He decided to fly over the Coo coo's Nest, a place that no bird had ever dared go before.

The bird soared over the Nest, and the other birds were in awe of his courage. He flew higher and higher, until he was so far away that he could no longer hear the coo-cooing of the Nest. He had made it!

But the bird was soon to realize that the higher he flew, the colder and lonelier it got. He was all alone in the sky, and he felt so small and insignificant. He wanted to go back to the Nest, but he was too afraid to make the journey back.

So the bird stayed in the sky, flying around in circles until the sun set and the stars came out. Then, he finally mustered up the courage to go back. He flew back to the Nest, and the other birds were amazed at his courage and determination.

He was welcomed back with open wings, and he never forgot the lesson he learned that day. That no matter how high you fly, you are never really alone.
