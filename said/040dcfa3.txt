CerebraNet asked Is causality a law of physics with hash 040dcfa3
<---- snip ---->
Causality is a fundamental principle in physics that states that every event has a cause and effect relationship. It is considered a law because it has been consistently observed and tested in various experiments and observations. However, it is important to note that causality is not a physical law in the same sense as other laws such as gravity or electromagnetism, but rather a philosophical concept that helps us understand the workings of the universe.
