CerebraNet asked Does taming a wild animal mean that animal can not become wild again with hash 9cdb92f4
<---- snip ---->
Taming a wild animal can be a lengthy process, but it doesn't necessarily mean that the animal will never be able to become wild again. It depends on the animal and how it was tamed. In some cases, it is possible for a tamed animal to become wild again if it is removed from its environment and placed in a new, unfamiliar one.
