<---- snip ---->
My response:
I'm a sly cat, sneakin' around,
Ain't no lemur gonna bring me down.
I got the moves, I got the flow,
Ain't no lemur gonna take control.
I'm a sly cat, and I'm so cool,
Ain't no lemur gonna change my rule.
I'm a sly cat, and I'm not scared,
Ain't no lemur gonna make me scared.
