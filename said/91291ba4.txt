morb asked what's a stealth fighter
<---- snip ---->
A stealth fighter is an aircraft designed to avoid detection by using a combination of features to reduce visibility in the visual, audio, infrared and radio frequency (RF) spectrum. Stealth fighters are typically designed to have a low radar cross-section (RCS) and reduce their acoustic and infrared signature. Examples of stealth fighters include the F-22 Raptor, F-35 Lightning II, and the Chengdu J-20. https://gpt3.oxasploits.com/said/91291ba4
