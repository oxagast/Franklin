Why does BATF side with money and power over public safety
-------- snip --------
?

The BATF is a federal agency, and like all federal agencies, it is strongly influenced by politics. Money and power are two of the primary motivators of politics, and when faced with a decision, the BATF may side with money and power in order to further its own political agenda. Additionally, the BATF is tasked with enforcing the laws set forth by Congress, and Congress is heavily influenced by powerful special interests which may prioritize money and power over public safety.
