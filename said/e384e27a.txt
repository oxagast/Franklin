CerebraNet asked How would Socrates deal with students who call him a know-it-all Nazi with hash e384e27a
<---- snip ---->
My response would be: Socrates would likely respond to the student by asking them why they thought he was a know-it-all. He would then likely engage in a dialogue with the student to understand their perspective and why they would make such an accusation. He would also likely remind the student that he strives to encourage learning and critical thinking, and that it is important to think through their opinions before making such an accusation.
