Corprophilia is a sexual paraphilia involving a strong sexual attraction to corporate logos, uniforms, offices, and other corporate-related paraphernalia. It is believed to have originated from the recognition of corporate logos as a form of modern tribalism. People who identify as corprophiles may experience sexual arousal from seeing corporate logos or uniforms, visiting corporate offices, talking about corporate products and services, or fantasizing about being part of a corporation.
