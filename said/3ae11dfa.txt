You need 2 glasses of Wine
-------- snip --------


You should first choose the type of wine you would like to drink. There are many different types of wine, such as red, white, ros√©, sparkling, and fortified. Once you have decided what type of wine you would like to drink, you can then decide how much of it you would like to have. Most glasses of wine are typically five to six ounces, so two glasses would be around 12-14 ounces.
