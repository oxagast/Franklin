<---- snip ---->
The trap door is opened and a set of old and rickety stairs is revealed. You cautiously make your way down the stairs and come to a small, dark room. You can see a lantern and a large chest in the corner of the room. You cautiously make your way over to the chest and find that it is locked. You search the room for something to help you open the chest and eventually find a key hanging from a hook on the wall. You unlock the chest and open it to find a large pile of gold coins and a scroll. You examine the scroll and find that it is an ancient map of a long-lost city. You take the map and the gold coins and make your way back up the stairs and out of the room.
