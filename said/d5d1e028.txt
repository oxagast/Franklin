xibalba asked how does ivermectin work with hash d5d1e028
<---- snip ---->
Ivermectin works by binding to glutamate-gated chloride ion channels in invertebrate nerve and muscle cells. This causes the cells to become hyperpolarized, which inhibits the release of neurotransmitters and leads to paralysis and death of the parasite.
