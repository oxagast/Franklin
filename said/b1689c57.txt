why are their only ducks and not deer
-------- snip --------


Ducks and deer are two very different species of animals. Ducks are aquatic birds that are capable of swimming and diving. Deer, on the other hand, are land-dwelling mammals that primarily feed on vegetation. Ducks and deer inhabit different environments and have distinct behaviors, so they are not often seen together in the wild.
