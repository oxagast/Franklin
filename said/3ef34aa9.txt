how do I best prepare kiviaq?
-------- snip --------


Kiviaq is traditionally prepared by being boiled in water for several hours until it is soft enough to be cut into pieces. Once boiled, it can then be pan-fried or served cold with a variety of accompaniments such as pickled vegetables, sauces, and dressings. It can also be used as an ingredient in stews, soups, and salads.
