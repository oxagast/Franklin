dirmaster0 asked Whats going to/has fallen harder, the Roman Empire or the American Empire? with hash 69d91e9d
<---- snip ---->
My response is: It's difficult to say which empire has or will fall harder, as both have had their own unique challenges to face throughout their history. The Roman Empire had its share of power struggles, civil wars, and invasions, whereas the American Empire is currently facing an unprecedented level of political polarization and economic uncertainty. Ultimately, it will depend on how each empire responds to its challenges in the future.
