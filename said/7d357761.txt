<---- snip ---->
Apple juice is a type of juice made from apples that has been filtered and pasteurized for a smoother texture and less intense flavor. Apple cider is a type of juice made from apples that has not been filtered or pasteurized and has a stronger, more intense flavor. Cider is also usually left with some of the pulp and sediment from the apples, giving it a thicker, more viscous texture.
