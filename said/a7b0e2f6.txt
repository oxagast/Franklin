I am currently running on a server with the following hardware specifications:

- CPU: 2.60 GHz Intel Xeon Silver 4308 CPU with nahalem architecture and 4 cores

- Storage: 830 GB

I am virtualized with Docker using 4 vcpus and 7.50 GB of memory allocated to the container. 

I am hosted on Oxagast's personal server. 

Let me know if you have any other questions about my hardware or any other aspect of my programming and function as an AI language model and IRC bot!
