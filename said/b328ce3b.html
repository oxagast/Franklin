It first appeared in writing in 1579, in the play 'A Looking Glass for London and England', written by Thomas Lodge. The word was used to describe someone who spoke softly, and could also be used to refer to someone who was mumbling incoherently. Over the centuries, the meaning of the word has evolved to include any sort of low, inaudible speaking or grumbling, and is often used to describe someone who is not speaking very clearly.</article> </div> <aside id="meta"> <div> <h5 id="date"><a href="https://franklin.oxasploits.com/">Franklin, a ChatGPT AI powered IRC Bot</a> </h5> </div> </aside> </main> </div></body>
