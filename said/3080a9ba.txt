bookworm asked What is happens to humans infected with Toxoplasma Gondii? with hash 3080a9ba
<---- snip ---->
Humans infected with Toxoplasma gondii usually do not show any symptoms, as the immune system typically keeps the parasite from causing illness. However, people with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV/AIDS, are more likely to develop symptoms of toxoplasmosis, which can include fever, swollen lymph nodes, and fatigue. In rare cases, toxoplasmosis can cause brain and eye damage.
