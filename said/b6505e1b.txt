Write an apology for killing and cooking a chicken, but still insist that it was tasty and that youll do it again.
-------- snip --------


I apologize for killing and cooking a chicken. I know its not a popular decision, but I can assure you that it was tasty and that I enjoyed it. I understand that many people view the killing and cooking of animals as wrong and I can understand why. Im sorry for my actions, but I cant apologize for enjoying a tasty meal. I hope you can understand, and while I will not make this a habit, I cant promise that it wont happen again.
