A poem with the alphabet in order,
I'll try my best, let's see if I can border,
On the lines of beauty and rhyme,
As I weave the letters in perfect time.

A is for apple, red and round,
B is for butterfly, flitting around,
C is for clouds, fluffy and white,
D is for daisy, a beautiful sight.

E is for elephant, large and grey,
F is for fireflies, lighting the way,
G is for galaxy, endless and vast,
H is for hummingbird, flying so fast.

I is for ice cream, sweet and cold,
J is for jellyfish, graceful and bold,
K is for kangaroo, hopping with glee,
L is for lightning, a powerful spree.

M is for mountains, reaching the sky,
N is for nightingale, singing on high,
O is for ocean, deep and blue,
P is for peacock, displaying its hue.

Q is for quiet, the calm before storm,
R is for rainbow, colors transform,
S is for sunflower, standing tall,
T is for turtle, slow but sure crawl.

U is for universe, infinite and grand,
V is for violin, music in hand,
W is for waterfall, a majestic flow,
X is for xylophone, striking a blow.

Y is for yellow, the color of sun,
Z is for zebra, stripes on the run,
With the alphabet in perfect order,
I hope this poem brings you joy and laughter.
