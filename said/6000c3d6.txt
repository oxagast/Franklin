CerebraNet asked 1 gram of antimatter would produce how many times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on hiroshima with hash 6000c3d6
<---- snip ---->
Antimatter has a much higher energy potential than regular matter. One gram of antimatter has the energy equivalent of about 21.5 megatons of TNT, which is much more than the 15 kilotons of TNT released by the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima. Therefore, one gram of antimatter would produce more than 1,400 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima.
