immortal-14 asked what is a typical muslum second name other than khann?? with hash b98d4364
<---- snip ---->
There are many common Muslim second names other than Khan, including Ahmed, Ali, Hassan, Hussain, Ibrahim, Mohammad, Mustafa, Rahman, Siddique, and Yusuf. These names are often chosen for their religious significance or to honor important figures in Islamic history. It is also common for Muslim families to use a combination of these names for their children, such as Ahmed Ali or Mohammad Hassan. Is there anything else I can assist you with?
