<---- snip ---->
The term "Limey" was originally used as a derogatory term to describe British sailors who were believed to consume limes to prevent scurvy. Limes were believed to contain high levels of Vitamin C, which helps the body resist scurvy. These days, the term is used as an affectionate term by British people to refer to their fellow countrymen.
