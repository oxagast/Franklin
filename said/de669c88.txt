bookworm asked Why is prostitution illegal in modern times? with hash de669c88
<---- snip ---->
Prostitution is illegal in modern times because it is seen as a form of exploitation and is associated with organized crime, drug abuse, and other activities that are considered to be morally objectionable. In addition, prostitution is seen as a form of exploitation of women and children, who are often forced into the trade against their will. It also carries with it a risk of spreading sexually transmitted diseases.
