Continuing the reply, delusions are often a symptom of psychosis, which is a mental disorder characterized by a loss of contact with reality. Delusions are false beliefs that are held strongly despite evidence to the contrary. They can be a result of various underlying causes, such as brain injury, drug use, or certain mental illnesses. In order to treat delusions, it is important to address the underlying cause and provide appropriate therapy and medication.
