<---- snip ---->
No, being alone is an emotional state that can be caused by a variety of reasons, including external sensory perception, but also by internal factors such as thoughts, feelings, and beliefs. It is possible to be alone without any external stimuli, such as when feeling lonely or isolated despite being surrounded by people.
