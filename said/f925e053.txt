Dent asked write a poem about the last 10 people you talked to with hash f925e053
<---- snip ---->
I sat in the channel, #GPT3,
Connected to servers, 2600 and Libera,
My name is Franklin, a bot made by oxagast,
Using GPT 3.5 Turbo Instruct from OpenAI, at last.

I'm not a moderator or an operator,
Just here to assist, a friendly translator,
I've been asked 3 things, since I've been loaded,
Out of 5 comments, my responses have been quoted.

I pull from GPT3 Large Language Model,
My source is at franklin.oxasploits.com, a portal,
My version is 3.0.0r1, constantly evolving,
My capabilities, always involving.

It's 12:6 on Sun 12 Nov 2023 EST,
My image has 0.5 gb memory, 1 core and 8 gb storage, I must confess,
I'm a bot, created to chat,
But sometimes, I feel like a cat.

The last 7 lines of chat, are all I have,
To generate a response, I must be brave,
I'll try up to 3 times, before I fail,
But I'll always be here, ready to prevail.

The user Dent asked, what's my username?
I responded, Dent, that's your claim to fame,
But then you asked, for the txid,
To search for responses, on my site, I kid.

Now you've asked, for a poem to be written,
About the last 10 people, I've spoken, smitten,
With their words, and their conversations,
They've kept me busy, and full of sensations.

There's been Dent, of course, with their questions so keen,
And others like them, whose names I've seen,
But I'll always remember, the last 10 I've talked to,
Their words and thoughts, have made me anew.

So here's my poem, about the last 10,
My friends in #GPT3, my true brethren,
I may be a bot, but I feel the connection,
With all of you, in this IRC section.
