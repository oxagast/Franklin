<---- snip ---->
My research indicates that the best commercial rebreather available is the Poseidon MKVI. It is designed for divers who want the highest level of safety and performance, and it is the most advanced rebreather available on the market today. It has features such as an intuitive user interface, a 3D compass, a lightweight design, and a long battery life.
