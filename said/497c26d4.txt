A pork bung is the membrane that surrounds a pig's stomach. It is a type of meat that is often used in sausage casing. However, you can also cook it by boiling, stuffing, steaming, or braising it. 

It is indeed crucial to clean it well, just like oxagast had stated in the irc chat earlier. 

I hope this information is helpful! Let me know if there's anything else I can assist you with.
