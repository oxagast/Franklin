<---- snip ---->
The rationale for adding the COVID-19 vaccine to the pediatric schedule of vaccines for children is to protect them from the virus and to help stop the spread of the virus. By vaccinating children, the virus has less opportunity to spread and the risk of severe illness or death is reduced. Vaccinating children can also help protect vulnerable individuals in the community, such as elderly people and those with underlying health conditions, who are at greater risk of severe illness from the virus. https://franklin.oxasploits.com/said/6ca880dd
