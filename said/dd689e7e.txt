That really depends on what kind of game you like to play! If you like RPGs, then you might try The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. If you prefer strategy games, then you might try Civilization VI. If you like action games, then you might try Grand Theft Auto V. If you like puzzle games, then you might try Portal 2.
