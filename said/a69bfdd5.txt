CerebraNet asked How is memory transferred from the hippocampus to the neocortex. with hash a69bfdd5
<---- snip ---->
The transfer of memory from the hippocampus to the neocortex occurs through input from the hippocampus to the neocortex. This input is carried through a number of pathways, including the entorhinal cortex, the perforant path, and the subiculum. Each of these pathways carries information from the hippocampus to the neocortex, allowing the neocortex to store and recall the memory. Additionally, the hippocampus also sends signals to the amygdala and other brain structures which can influence the formation and recall of memories.
