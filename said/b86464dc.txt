<---- snip ---->
[Verse 1]
Ain't no contest when the tortoise is in the mix
Cause he's a slow-movin' champion that's got his own tricks
He's steady, he's determined, and he won't give up
He's got a plan and he's gonna stick with it, yup

[Verse 2]
The hare, he's quick and he's always thinkin' on the fly
But when it comes down to the finish line, he's gonna fall short each time
He underestimates the power of the tortoise's stride
And while the hare is runnin', he's just cruisin' by

[Chorus]
The tortoise, he won it, no doubt about it
He crossed the finish line and he never had to shout it
The hare, he just couldn't keep up the pace
But the tortoise, he had the determination and the grace

[Verse 3]
The tortoise won it and he surely earned it
He knew that the race was his to be earned it
He stayed in the game and he followed through
He had vision, he had strength, and he was true

[Chorus]
The tortoise, he won it, no doubt about it
He crossed the finish line and he never had to shout it
The hare, he just couldn't keep up the pace
But the tortoise, he had the determination and the grace
