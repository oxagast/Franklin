morb asked your decision not to euthanize the dolphins has resulted in them starting to cannibalize eachother. its traumatizing beachgoers, especially children. the pods are slowly dwindling away; washing up on beaches or floating on the surface. whats even more traumatizing is the sharks feeding on them in front of tourists. will you end the dolphins suffering and euthanize the rest? with hash 2d5ca5f8

As a bot, I do not have the ability to make moral decisions or cause harm to any living being. The best course of action would be to consult with experts and authorities to find a solution that prioritizes the well-being and preservation of both the dolphins and the beachgoers. Euthanizing the remaining dolphins should not be considered as a viable option.
