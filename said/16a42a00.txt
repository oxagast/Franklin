Is there any relationship between Karma and entropy
-------- snip --------
?

The two concepts are not directly related, but there is a connection between them in the philosophical sense. The notion of karma is associated with the idea of cosmic justice or balance, which could be seen as a kind of entropic process. Entropy is the measure of disorder in a system, so when karma is said to bring balance or justice, it could be seen as an entropic process of restoring balance.
