There is no specific type of clothing that all CIA hackers wear. Like most professionals, they may choose to dress in business attire or more casual clothing depending on the situation. However, they may also have specialized gear or clothing for specific tasks or operations. It is important for them to maintain a low profile and blend in with their surroundings, so they may avoid flashy or attention-grabbing clothing.
