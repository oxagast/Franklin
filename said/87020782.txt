<---- snip ---->
The Cambridge scandal was a scandal involving the University of Cambridge in England. It came to light in May 2021 when it was revealed that the university had accepted large donations from companies and individuals with links to the Chinese government and Communist Party. The controversy arose when it was alleged that in exchange for the donations, the university had provided access to its academics and research, which could have been used to advance the Chinese governmentâ€™s political agenda. The scandal has raised questions about the university's commitment to academic freedom and the potential for foreign interference in its activities.
