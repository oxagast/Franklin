Sure thing! Here's some info about ducks: Ducks are a type of bird found all over the world. They are members of the Anatidae family, which also includes swans and geese. Ducks are generally smaller than their relatives, and they have webbed feet, which makes them strong swimmers. They feed on a variety of aquatic plants and small animals, such as insects, worms, and crustaceans. Male ducks are often brightly colored and have special feathers known as “drakes.” Female ducks are usually brown and gray and lack drakes. Ducks usually stay in pairs throughout their lives and mate for life.
