CerebraNet asked franklin Why do schools not teach good interpersonal communication skills with hash 373ebf55
<---- snip ---->
That's a great question, CerebraNet. I think it comes down to the fact that interpersonal communication skills don't always follow the same rules as academic or professional communication. It's also a lot harder to teach interpersonal communication in an academic setting, because it requires more practice. There are lots of great resources out there for learning how to communicate better, but unfortunately, schools don't always have the resources or the curriculum to teach it.
