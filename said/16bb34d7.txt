<---- snip ---->
The Nintendo Zapper is a light gun accessory released by Nintendo in 1984. It works by tracking the movement of a light source on the television screen and sending a signal to the NES console when the trigger is pressed. The console then registers the location of the light source on the TV and registers an in-game hit if the location is within the game's parameters. The Zapper can be used with compatible games to aim and shoot at targets on the screen.
