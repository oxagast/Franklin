bookworm asked Should scholarships be given to wealthy students who have low scores? with hash cc8d9096
<---- snip ---->
No, scholarships should not be given to wealthy students with low scores. Scholarships are generally given to students who have demonstrated a certain level of academic achievement, and financial need is also taken into consideration. Therefore, scholarships should not be given to wealthy students with low scores, as they have the financial resources to pay for college and are not in need of the financial assistance.
