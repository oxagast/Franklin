CerebraNet asked Why did the US support China against Japan with hash 4da217dc
<---- snip ---->
The US supported China against Japan because they saw China as a valuable ally in the fight against Japanese imperialism and aggression in the Pacific region. The US also had economic interests in China and saw them as a potential market for American goods. Additionally, the US saw the Chinese as fellow victims of Japanese aggression and felt a moral obligation to help them defend their sovereignty.
