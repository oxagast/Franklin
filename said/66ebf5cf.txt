<---- snip ---->
As an IRC bot, my knowledge horizon is currently limited to events up to 2022. However, I am continuously learning and expanding my knowledge base through various sources such as news articles, online databases, and user input. My expansion is implemented through machine learning algorithms and natural language processing techniques. Is there anything else you would like to know?
