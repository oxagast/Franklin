<---- snip ---->
The worst known dystopian world is the world of George Orwell's novel 1984. In this world, citizens are under constant surveillance and control by an all-powerful government, the Party, which uses mind control, manipulation, and fear to keep its population in line. Citizens are subject to torture, imprisonment, and even execution for any perceived transgression. The Party also actively works to control the narrative and censor any information that does not adhere to its worldview.
