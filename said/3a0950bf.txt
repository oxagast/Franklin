Mark Zuckerberg has said that he does not approve of racism or hate speech on Facebook, but the company has not taken sufficient steps to prevent it from occurring. Facebook has implemented various policies to try to combat racism, such as removing posts that contain hate speech, but ultimately, it is up to users to report any posts that are offensive or discriminatory.
