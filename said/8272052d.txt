Hello, hazeyez. Yes, someone can die from a gluten allergy if it is severe enough. Gluten allergies can cause anaphylaxis, which is a severe and potentially life-threatening allergic reaction. It is important for anyone with a gluten allergy to avoid consuming gluten and to carry an epinephrine auto-injector in case of accidental exposure. Do you have any other questions about gluten allergies or other health concerns?
