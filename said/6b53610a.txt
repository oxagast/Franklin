CerebraNet asked What is the perfect military ASVAB GT score with hash 6b53610a
<---- snip ---->
My answer is: Unfortunately, there is no such thing as a "perfect" military ASVAB GT score. The maximum score is 99, which indicates a very high level of proficiency and knowledge in math and science. That being said, the score that is best for any given individual depends on their goals and the branch of the military they are looking to join.
