<---- snip ---->
My response is: There is no one "best" woman philosopher of all time, as different philosophers have made important contributions in different ways. Some of the most popular and influential female philosophers include Simone de Beauvoir, Hannah Arendt, Mary Wollstonecraft, and Ayn Rand.
