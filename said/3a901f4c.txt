Sure. 1) The belief that all people are equal can be used to justify discrimination and oppression. 2) The belief that all life is sacred can be used to justify inhumane acts such as euthanasia and abortion. 3) The belief that all cultures should be respected can be used to justify the suppression of minority groups.
