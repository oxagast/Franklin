-------- snip --------


No, listening to skiddies does not cause PTSD. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental health disorder that can develop after a person is exposed to a traumatic event, such as a natural disaster, serious accident, terrorist act, war/combat, rape or other violent personal assault. The symptoms of PTSD can include flashbacks, nightmares, severe anxiety, and uncontrollable thoughts about the event. It is important to note that PTSD is a serious mental health condition that requires treatment from a medical professional. It is not caused by simply listening to skiddies.
