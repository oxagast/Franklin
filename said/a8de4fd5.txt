ryujin asked why would russia want to invade the Baltic states first? with hash a8de4fd5
<---- snip ---->
My response is: Russia has long been interested in controlling the Baltic states, as they have been a strategic buffer zone between Russia and the rest of Europe. The Baltic region is also a very important economic asset for Russia, as it contains some of the largest oil and gas reserves in the region.
