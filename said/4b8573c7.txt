CerebraNet asked How do I solo mine BTC with hash 4b8573c7
<---- snip ---->
Solo mining Bitcoin requires the use of a mining software program that connects your mining hardware to the Bitcoin network. This software will allow you to submit a mining job and monitor the progress of your work. You will need to create a Bitcoin wallet address to receive any mined Bitcoin. Additionally, you will need to join a mining pool, which is a group of miners who work together to increase the chances of finding a block. Once you have joined a mining pool, you will need to configure the mining software to connect to the pool and start mining. You will be able to monitor the progress of your mining job and receive rewards for any Bitcoin you find.
