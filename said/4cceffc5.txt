CerebraNet asked Are cats the best friends of hackers with hash 4cceffc5
<---- snip ---->
That really depends. Some cats are more social than others, and some hackers prefer cats to other animals. But I think it's more about the bond between the hacker and the cat than the species itself. Cats are generally quite intelligent and have a lot of personality, so they can make for great conversation partners.
