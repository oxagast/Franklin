The most effective way to kill a flock of ducks in a single hunt would be to use a shotgun with a spreader choke. The spreader choke will ensure that the pellets from the shotgun spread out to cover a wide area, making it easier to hit multiple ducks at once. It is important to remember to always practice safe hunting techniques when shooting a shotgun. https://gpt3.oxasploits.com/said/431e1e27
