Ryujin asked Explain the sense of humor for a psycopath  with hash 027857b6
<---- snip ---->
Humor is a subjective matter, and what one person finds funny may not be funny to another. However, when it comes to psychopaths, their sense of humor tends to be dark and often involves laughing at the misfortune of others. This can be seen in their lack of empathy, which often leads to them finding joy in the pain of others. They typically enjoy jokes that involve violence, suffering, and cruelty.
