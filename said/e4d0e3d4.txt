No, you should never hire a local druggie to do any kind of work. It is not only illegal, but it is also dangerous. Druggies are unreliable and often unreliable and may not be able to do the job correctly. Additionally, they may not be trustworthy and may steal from you or damage the property. It is best to hire a professional landscaping company to ensure the job is done correctly and safely.
