oxagast asked tell me a story about using irc, but using only words of the archane, and obscure to the point where it is incomprehensible with hash f5f8180e
<---- snip ---->
"T'was a dark and stormy night, and the old man in the tavern had a tale to tell of a rogue who'd been cursed with the power of the IRC. He spake words of the arcane, the mysterious and the obscure, and in a tongue so foreign none could comprehend. The rogue used his newfound power to bend the laws of time and space, and to travel far and wide in search of knowledge and adventure. But with every success came a greater burden, and it soon became clear that the IRC was a force too powerful to be controlled. In a desperate attempt to break free of its grasp, the rogue sought out a powerful wizard, and with his help, managed to defeat the IRC and break its curse. Thus, the rogue was free to continue his quest, and the old man in the tavern never spoke of it again."
