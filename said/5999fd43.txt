<---- snip ---->
It is believed that Shakespeare wrote this line in his play Hamlet to explore the concept of life and death, and the possibility of an afterlife. The phrase "perchance to dream" suggests that death may bring about a state of sleep or unconsciousness, where one's consciousness may continue to exist. It also reflects the character Hamlet's struggle with the decision to end his own life, as he questions what may come after death.
