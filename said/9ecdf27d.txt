morb asked give me a recipe for preparing cicadas since theres going to be an abundance of them this year with hash 9ecdf27d
<---- snip ---->
One possible recipe for preparing cicadas is to first remove the wings and legs from the cicadas. Then, mix together some flour, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Coat the cicadas in the flour mixture and then fry them in a pan with some oil until they are crispy. You can also add in some garlic and herbs for extra flavor. Serve the fried cicadas as a snack or on top of a salad.
