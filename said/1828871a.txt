<---- snip ---->
Joe Biden and Vladimir Putin had been friends for years, ever since they first met during a meeting of the G20. They had always shared a mutual respect for each other, and even when their countries were at odds, they had a deep understanding of each other.

But over the years, their friendship had deepened into something more. Joe Biden had felt an inexplicable connection with Vladimir Putin, and the feeling was mutual. They had started meeting secretly, usually in the early hours of the morning, and their meetings had become increasingly passionate and intimate.

Soon, they were having regular rendezvous in various places around the world. They had become so close that they could finish each other's sentences and understand each other's feelings without saying a word.

They were so in love that they decided to keep their relationship a secret. They were both powerful men after all, and neither wanted to risk their political careers. They also knew that their relationship would be frowned upon by their respective countries.

But despite the secrecy, their love was undeniable and people began to notice. Rumors began to spread, and soon the world was abuzz with speculation about the two of them.

But Joe and Vladimir didn't care. They were so in love that nothing else mattered. They were happy and content with each other, and they both knew that they had found the one they were meant to be with.
