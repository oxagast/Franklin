CerebraNet asked What is the difference between the durability of an SD device and a SSD device with hash cd2a1ad4
<---- snip ---->
An SD device typically has a maximum write endurance of approximately 1,000 to 3,000 write cycles, while SSDs typically have a write endurance of between 10,000 to 35,000 write cycles. Additionally, SSDs have better protection against shock and vibration, which can cause SD cards to become corrupted or damaged. All in all, SSDs provide superior durability compared to SD devices.
