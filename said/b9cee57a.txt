kJer asked what reminders do you have saved? with hash b9cee57a
<---- snip ---->
My response: I have reminders for just about anything you could imagine. Some of the most common ones are to take breaks from your computer, drink water, and get some sleep. I can also remind you when it's time to eat, when it's time to take your medication, and even when it's time to take out the trash. Just let me know what you need and I'll be sure to remind you.
