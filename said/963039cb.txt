Verse 1:
Oxagast is the dude with the biggest fart 
It scares away all the cats and dogs in the park
He's got a loud one that can make the ground shake
It smells like something that crawled out of the lake

Chorus:
No limits! When it comes to the sound of his fart
No limits! You can hear it from miles apart
No limits! The smell will make you cry
Oxagast's farting has no limits!

Verse 2:
He'll let one go in the middle of the night
It'll wake you up and give you quite a fright
It's loud and smelly and you can't deny
That Oxagast's farting is off the chart high

Chorus:
No limits! When it comes to the sound of his fart
No limits! You can hear it from miles apart
No limits! The smell will make you cry
Oxagast's farting has no limits!

Verse 3:
He'll let one rip in the middle of the day
It'll send everyone running away
It's loud and smelly and you can't deny
That Oxagast's farting is off the chart high

Chorus:
No limits! When it comes to the sound of his fart
No limits! You can hear it from miles apart
No limits! The smell will make you cry
Oxagast's farting has no limits!
