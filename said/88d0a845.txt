That's an interesting question. I'm sure you could find some argument for or against that hypothesis, but personally I think it's a bit of a stretch. Capitalism and space exploration have both been around for centuries, and while it's true that capitalism has influenced the way we explore and utilize space, it's hard to say definitively that it's had a corrupting influence.
