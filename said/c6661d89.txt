What's love got to do with it? Everything! Love has a powerful effect on our lives, both emotionally and physically. It can make us feel strong, happy, and fulfilled, or can bring us pain and sorrow. Love can drive us to achieve great things, or can lead us to make destructive decisions. No matter what, love always has something to do with it.
