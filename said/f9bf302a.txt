morb asked explain how chains help captivate disc golf holes with hash f9bf302a
<---- snip ---->
Chains are important to disc golf because they help control the direction and distance of the disc. They act as a kind of magnet for the disc, making it more likely to land in the basket. Chains also make it harder for the disc to skip or roll away from the basket, making it more likely for the disc to land in the basket. Finally, the chains can add a bit of a challenge to the game, making it more interesting and exciting for all players.
