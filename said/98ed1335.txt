<---- snip ---->
Once upon a time, there was a fat man named Bob who had a strange condition. He could not eat unless he masturbated first.

Bob had been living with this condition his entire life, and it had become a part of his daily routine. Every morning he would wake up, masturbate, and then eat a large breakfast. He would then go about his day and repeat the same process for lunch and dinner.

It was a strange way to live, but Bob had accepted it as part of his life. That is, until one day when he was out with friends.

Bob had just finished a big meal when his friends asked him if he was going to eat anything else. Bob hesitated, not wanting to admit the truth, but eventually confessed that he could not eat unless he masturbated first.

His friends, shocked at this revelation, tried to encourage him to seek out professional help. But Bob refused, not wanting to talk about such a personal issue with strangers.

So Bob continued to live his life, eating only when he masturbated first. He was content, but a part of him wished he could find a solution to his problem.

One day, however, he stumbled across an article about a study that claimed masturbation could help people with weight issues. With a newfound hope, he decided to give it a try.

Bob was amazed to find that it actually worked! Before long, he was able to enjoy meals without having to masturbate first.

He was finally free of his strange condition, and could live a normal life. He was grateful to have found the solution, and was thankful for the power of science.
