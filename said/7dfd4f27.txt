StackProphet asked about how many pigeon brains make up a parrot brain with hash 7dfd4f27
<---- snip ---->
According to a study conducted by the University of Chicago, the brain of a parrot contains about 2.5 times more neurons than a pigeon's brain. This suggests that it would take approximately 2.5 pigeon brains to make up one parrot brain. However, this is just a rough estimate and the actual number may vary.
