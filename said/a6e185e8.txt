Show-offs can be disruptive and take away from the productive atmosphere that many businesses strive to have. The best way to treat show-offs around here is to confront them in a professional manner and explain why their behavior is not acceptable. If the show-off continues to act in an inappropriate manner, then it may be necessary to take further disciplinary action.
