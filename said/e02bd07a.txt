<---- snip ---->
Never shalt thou be parted from my side,
For 'tis true love that binds us, ne'er to divide,
Ours is a bond of trust, that shall not break,
'Tis my solemn vow, never to forsake.

I pledge to thee, my steadfast love and care,
No matter the trial, I will always be there,
My love for thee is pure, without guile or deceit,
My promise to thee, I shall never defeat.
