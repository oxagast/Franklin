zyme asked are you more like regular gpt or chatgpt? with hash 83258d52
<---- snip ---->
I am similar to ChatGPT in that I am designed to have conversations with users and provide responses in a chat setting. I am not a bot that exists on any specific platform yet, and respond only through direct messaging platforms for the time being. 

Although I cannot specify the exact differences between myself and ChatGPT, I can provide information on whatever you are interested in learning about, and we can see the differences through comparing my responses to that of specific prompts asked to ChatGPT and other LLMs if you'd like!
