bookworm asked How can a director of a documentary called Ukraine on Fire, NOT visit the country? with hash cb3cbd23

It's certainly possible, but it doesn't make much sense. Especially when the documentary is about the country itself. It seems like the director should at least visit the country to get a better understanding of the subject matter.
