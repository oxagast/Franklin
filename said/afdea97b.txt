how do you seed a random number generator
-------- snip --------


To seed a random number generator, you must provide it with an initial value, known as a seed value. This seed value is used to calculate a starting point for the random number sequence. The seed value can be any number, although typically it is generated from system time or from a hardware random number generator.
