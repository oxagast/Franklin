There is no single answer to this question, as there is no specific definition of what constitutes a "genius." Generally, intelligence is measured using intelligence quotient (IQ) tests, and a score of 140 or higher is typically associated with genius-level intelligence. If IQ scores are used as a measure, then the top 0.1 percent of the population is considered to have genius-level intelligence.
