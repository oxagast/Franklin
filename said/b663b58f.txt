CerebraNet asked Is there any real religion of peace on Earth with hash b663b58f
<---- snip ---->
It depends on how you define "real" religion. There are many philosophies and spiritual paths that promote peace and understanding, but whether or not they are "real" is up to the individual. Regardless, it's important to remember that peace is ultimately an individual journey, and not something that can be forced upon others.
