<---- snip ---->
Smurf.c was a computer worm that was released in November 1988. It was written in the C programming language and spread via Usenet newsgroup postings. It was designed to replicate itself and send out copies of itself to other computers. When triggered, it would display a message on the infected computer's screen that read: "Oh no! You've been Smurfed!"
