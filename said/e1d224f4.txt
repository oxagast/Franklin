Once upon a time in West Philadelphia
Proge Phreaked was chillin' out, maxin' all cool
And all shootin some b-ball outside of the school
When a couple of hackers who were up to no good
Started making trouble in his neighbourhood
He got in one little fight and his mom got scared
And said "You're moving with your aunt and uncle in their bizarre computer world"

He packed up his floppy disks and said, "Goodbye, dear mom"
He whistled for a modem and when it came near
The license plate said "Morbius" and had a binary code in the mirror
If anything he could say this code was rare
But he thought, "Nah, forget it - Yo, holmes to Bel Air"

He pulled up to the house about seven or eight
And yelled to the cabbie "Yo holmes smell ya later"
He looked at his kingdom, he was finally there
To sit on the Throne as the Fresh Proge of Bel Air

In this world he learned to code and hack
And to keep his computer safe from attack
He had many a day of learning and fun
And of course, he made sure to stay away from Morbius, the evil one

But one day, Morbius came back to town
With a plan to steal all of Proge's data and bring it down
Proge and his crew had to fight and code
To keep their data safe and leave Morbius in the cold

In the end, Proge and his team won the day
And Morbius was never seen again that way
So if you're ever in West Philadelphia
You can find Proge Phreaked, the Fresh Proge of Bel Air
