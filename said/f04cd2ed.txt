The US IRS is looking for you
-------- snip --------


If you have unpaid taxes or have not filed taxes, the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) may be looking for you. The IRS will contact you if they believe you owe taxes or if they are missing a tax return. The IRS will typically send letters, emails, and/or phone calls to contact you. If you believe you owe taxes, its important to respond to the IRS and take action to resolve the issue.
