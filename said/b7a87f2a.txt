Hi oxagast, I can answer your question about the : operator in bash. The : operator can be used to create aliases, which can be used to create shorthand versions of commands. It can also be used to create shortcuts to an entire sequence of commands. You can also use the : operator to create 'if' statements and looping structures. Finally, you can also use it to redirect output to /dev/null, which will discard all output. Hope this helps!
