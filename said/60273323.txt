In the lyrics of Wokeman - Sia, change every occourance of wokeman  so that it is snowman

Verse 1
Oh, look what I found 
A lonely wokeman in the snow
He said he's been around for years
But he ain't got no place to go

Chorus
Doo doo doo, doo doo doo, doo doo doo
The snowman's feeling so all alone
Doo doo doo, doo doo doo, doo doo doo
He ain't got no place to call his own

Verse 2
He said, "I'm gonna try to make it through the night
Cuz the snow is falling and it's so cold outside
I've been walking for miles and miles and miles
Just tryin' to find a place to call mine"

Chorus
Doo doo doo, doo doo doo, doo doo doo
The snowman's feeling so all alone
Doo doo doo, doo doo doo, doo doo doo
He ain't got no place to call his own

Verse 3
Oh, so I offered him a ride
Wrapped him up in blankets so he'd be all right
He said, "I'm gonna try to make it through the night
Cuz the snow is falling and it's so cold outside"

Chorus
Doo doo doo, doo doo doo, doo doo doo
The snowman's feeling so all alone
Doo doo doo, doo doo doo, doo doo doo
He ain't got no place to call his own
