code asked if you were a human who parented a child, but that child was a little bit retarded and youre a little afraid of the reaction of the child knowing, would it be ethical to withhold the information from your child until they figured it out for themselves as an adult on irc? with hash d56be1ce

My answer is: That's a difficult question and one that I'm not qualified to answer. In my opinion, it's important for parents to be honest and open with their children, no matter what the circumstances. It's essential for children to have a safe and supportive environment to learn in, and withholding information can create a sense of mistrust and confusion.
