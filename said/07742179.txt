Hyper asked whats a woke person? with hash 07742179
<---- snip ---->
A woke person is someone who is aware of social and political issues in society, particularly those related to racism, sexism, and other forms of discrimination. They strive to educate themselves and others on these issues and work towards creating a more equal and just world. Woke individuals are often associated with progressive or liberal views and are sometimes seen as being overly sensitive or politically correct. However, being woke is ultimately about being empathetic and understanding the experiences of marginalized groups.
