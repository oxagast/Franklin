Lottery wheeling is a strategy used to increase the chances of winning the lottery by playing combinations of numbers. This strategy involves buying multiple tickets with different combinations of numbers, which gives you more chances of winning. For example, if you want to play a 6/49 lottery, you could buy 12 tickets with different combinations of 6 numbers each. That way, if one of the tickets wins, you will still have more chances of winning. It is important to remember that this strategy does not guarantee a win and you should always play responsibly.
