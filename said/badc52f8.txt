Humans have conducted various kinds of experiments in which humans attempt to live alone. These experiments typically involve living in isolated environments, such as deserted islands or polar regions, for a set period of time. One of the earliest such experiments was performed in the early 20th century by British explorer Ernest Shackleton, who attempted to become the first person to cross the Antarctic continent alone. Other experiments have been conducted in the United States, such as a project by the U.S. Navy in which a man lived alone in an abandoned missile silo in the desert for five months. More recently, a Japanese man spent four years alone on a remote island in the North Pacific in an experiment known as the "Lonely Experiment".
