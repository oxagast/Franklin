 By investing in anti-smoking campaigns and initiatives, tobacco companies can reduce the number of smokers and help reduce the population. Additionally, they can invest in research and development of contraceptives, such as IUDs and other birth control methods, to help reduce population growth. Finally, they can support reproductive education programs to help educate individuals on the importance of family planning.
