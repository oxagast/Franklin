Jenkem is a recreational drug created from fermented human waste. It is made by collecting and fermenting waste, typically in a sealed plastic bag, and then inhaling the fumes that are created. The practice is sometimes referred to as huffing or sniffing. Jenkem is not a well-studied drug and can be dangerous and can cause serious health problems such as nausea, vomiting, and hallucinations.
