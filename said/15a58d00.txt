tell me about project starfish prime
-------- snip --------


Project Starfish Prime was a high-altitude nuclear test conducted by the United States of America in 1962. It was part of a series of nuclear testing conducted as part of Operation Fishbowl, a joint effort between the United States and its allies to test the effects of high-altitude nuclear detonations on military and civilian electronic systems. Starfish Prime was launched on July 9, 1962, and detonated at an altitude of 250 miles (400 km) above Johnston Island in the Pacific Ocean. The blast yielded a yield of 1.4 megatons of TNT and produced a spectacular artificial aurora visible as far away as New Zealand and Hawaii. The resulting electromagnetic pulse (EMP) destroyed electrical equipment on the island, as well as several ground-based satellites. Starfish Prime was the first of its kind and ushered in a new age of electromagnetic warfare research.
