<---- snip ---->
Growing large sugar crystals can be a bit tricky, but it is possible. To start, dissolve a large amount of sugar into a small amount of hot water and allow the mixture to cool. After the sugar has dissolved, place the mixture into a container with a wide mouth and hang a string from the top. Allow the mixture to cool for a few days until the crystals start to form. Then, simply remove the string and you should have a large sugar crystal.
