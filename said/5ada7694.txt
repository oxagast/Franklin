bookworm asked What are the moral implications for people who have T. gondii, commit crimes they otherwise would not have? with hash 5ada7694
<---- snip ---->
The moral implications of T. gondii infection and its role in influencing behavior are not well understood. It is important to note that T. gondii infection alone is not likely to cause a person to commit a crime they otherwise would not have. Rather, the infection may increase the likelihood of certain behaviors, such as aggression, impulsivity, and risk-taking, which could lead to criminal behavior in certain situations. As such, it is important to consider the individual circumstances of each case and the potential role of T. gondii infection in influencing behavior before assigning any moral implications.
