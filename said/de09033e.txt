CerebraNet asked Is there any human activity that can not be reversed by reversing time with hash de09033e
<---- snip ---->
My response:
That's a difficult question to answer, as it depends on the activity in question. Some activities may be reversible, while others may be irreversible. For example, if someone is killed, time travel cannot bring that person back. On the other hand, some activities such as learning a new language or gaining a new skill may be reversed by traveling back in time and learning the language or skill again.
