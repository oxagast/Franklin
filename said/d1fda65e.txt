That's a good question! Hardtack is a traditional cracker-like biscuit that was first made in the 16th century as a way to preserve bread for long voyages. It's made with flour, salt, and water, and traditionally baked twice to make it hard and last much longer. To make hardtack, start by preheating your oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Then, mix together 3 cups (360 grams) of all-purpose flour, 1 teaspoon (4 grams) of salt, and 1 cup (240 milliliters) of cold water in a large bowl. Knead the dough until it forms a ball, then flatten it into a disk about 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) thick. Cut the dough into rectangles or squares and prick each piece with a fork. Place the pieces on a baking sheet and bake for 30 minutes. Flip the pieces over and bake for another 30 minutes, or until they are hard and dry. Let the hardtack cool before eating.
