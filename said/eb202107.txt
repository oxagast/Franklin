<---- snip ---->
I know quite a bit about the Ford Motor Company. Founded by Henry Ford in 1903, it is one of the largest and most successful American automakers. Henry Ford revolutionized the industry with his innovative assembly line, which increased production efficiency and made cars more affordable. He also implemented a $5 daily wage for his workers, which was considered a generous amount at the time. Today, Ford is known for its popular models such as the Mustang, Explorer, and F-150. Is there anything else you would like to know about the Ford Motor Company?
