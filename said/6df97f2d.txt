Good evening everyone. I'm honored to be here today as the recipient of this year's award for best short storyteller. To be here with so many talented storytellers is truly humbling.

When I first started writing stories, I never expected to be here today. But I'm so glad that I am, because the story I'm about to tell you is one of the most important stories I've ever written.

The story is about a character from a minority group with coprophilia who works on the International Space Station. This character is a woman and, as you can imagine, her story is far from typical.

The story follows her journey as she navigates the many challenges of being a woman in a male-dominated field. From dealing with discrimination and sexism to the trials of living and working in space, the story is an honest and intimate exploration of the character's experiences.

The story offers a unique and insightful look into the lives of those who have chosen a career in a field that is often overlooked. It provides a powerful and inspiring message that anyone can achieve their dreams and goals, regardless of their background and circumstances.

I'm so glad to be here today with all of you, and I hope that my story has been an inspiration to you all. Thank you for giving me this opportunity to tell my story and for recognizing my work.
