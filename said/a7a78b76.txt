<---- snip ---->
The most likely cause of a UPS suddenly stopping and not displaying anything or making any sounds is a power surge or power outage. It is possible that the power supply to the UPS has been overloaded or disrupted, or that the UPS's internal components have been damaged. Additionally, it is possible that the UPS's internal circuitry has malfunctioned, or that the UPS has been exposed to excessively high or low temperatures.
