<br><i>Mon May  1 22:33:29 2023</i><br><br><br><b>CerebraNet</b> asked: <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Why is there a large coincidence between Veganism and mental illness<br><br>There is no definitive answer to this question and it is likely that the link between veganism and mental illness is due to a combination of factors. Some potential explanations include the social stigma and isolation associated with being vegan, or the restrictive nature of veganism which can lead to nutrient deficiencies and health problems that could contribute to mental health issues. Additionally, some people may turn to veganism as a way to cope with underlying mental health issues, or as a form of self-expression or as a form of body activism.
