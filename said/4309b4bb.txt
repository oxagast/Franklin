Goatse is an internet shock site that first appeared in the late 1990s. It consists of an image of a man, whose buttocks are exposed and gaping, with the phrase "goatse.cx" printed across the image. The man in the image is widely believed to be the site's creator, known only by his online pseudonym "goatse".

Goatse is known for its extreme shock value, as well as its grotesque nature. The site has been described as one of the most notorious shock sites in existence. The image of the man has been used in numerous internet memes and parodies, as well as being featured in a variety of other media. It has also been used in various pranks and jests.
