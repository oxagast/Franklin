?

The Architect is the creator of the Matrix, a virtual reality world that exists within the physical world. He manipulates the Matrix in a number of ways, including creating the rules and programs that govern the Matrix, controlling the Matrixs code, and programming the Matrix to create new simulations within the Matrix. He also has the ability to alter or delete programs, rewrite code, and even control the minds of those within the Matrix. By controlling the Matrix, he can control the lives of those within it, manipulating their thoughts and decisions to his own benefit.
