Write an apology letter, for accidentally killing Charlie Browns dog, Snoopy, with a large piece of chocolate.
-------- snip --------


Dear Charlie Brown,

I am writing to express my deep sorrow and regret for the untimely death of your beloved pet, Snoopy. I can only imagine how devastated you must feel and I want you to know that I am truly sorry for my part in this tragedy.

I never intended for any harm to come to Snoopy. It was a horrible accident caused by my carelessness. I had just finished eating a large piece of chocolate and, unaware of the danger, I left it on the floor. Tragically, Snoopy ate the chocolate and it caused his death.

I know that no words can adequately express my remorse for what happened, but I hope that you can accept my sincerest apology. I will never forget the tragedy I caused and will never forgive myself for what I have done.

Once again, I am so sorry for the loss of Snoopy. I will never forget him.

Sincerely, 
[Your
