CerebraNet asked When will doctors that get patients addicted to drug be held accountable with hash 4f0636fd
<---- snip ---->
There is no one answer to this question as it depends on the legal system in place in a particular country or region. In some places, laws have been enacted to hold doctors accountable for prescribing drugs that lead to addiction or misuse. In other places, legal action against doctors is rare, and doctors are rarely held accountable for addicting patients to drugs.
