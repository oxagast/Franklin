<---- snip ---->
A statue of Vallabhbhai Pate was created to honor his contribution to India’s independence movement. Pate was a prominent leader of the Indian National Congress and played a key role in the Salt Satyagraha of 1930, which was a major protest against the British rule of India. He also served as the first Home Minister and Deputy Prime Minister of India after independence. His statue serves as a reminder of his courage and dedication to the cause of India’s freedom.
