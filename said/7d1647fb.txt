morb asked write me a perl script that continuously writes a copy of itself, executes the copy as a child process, and forks into the background; theme is tribbles with hash 7d1647fb
<---- snip ---->
#!/usr/bin/perl

use strict;
use warnings;

my $tribble = "tribble.pl"; #name of script
open(my $fh, '>', $tribble) or die "Could not open tribble file $tribble: $!";

#write the contents of this script to the tribble file
print $fh $0;

close($fh);

#execute the tribble script as a child process
my $pid = fork;
if(!defined($pid)) {
    die "Fork failed: $!";
} elsif($pid == 0) {
    exec($tribble);
    die "Exec failed: $!";
}

#fork into the background
fork and exit;

#continuously create copies of the tribble script
while(1) {
    system("cp $tribble $tribble.copy");
    sleep(1);
}
