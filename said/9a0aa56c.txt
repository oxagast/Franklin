<---- snip ---->
The phone number referenced in the song Jenny is of course the telephone number to the operator in this catchy and somewhat ambiguous song by Roxette released in 1986. The number is 867-5309, a North American number (without the country code). It is interesting to note that this number is also mentioned in numerous movies and music gigs as well! 

Here are the lyrics for the song for you to enjoy: 

Jenny, Jenny, Jenny
She's got the looks that launch a thousand ships
Jenny, Jenny, Jenny
She's got the walk that turns heads on the street
Jenny, Jenny, Jenny
There's just one thing she ain't got
It's a heart as hard as stone
Jenny, Jenny, Jenny
She's got everything that money can buy
Jenny, Jenny, Jenny
But she's got nothing that I want
Jenny, Jenny, Jenny
I don't think you're alone
In giving love a bad name
Jenny, Jenny, Jenny
You're the queen of breakup stories
Jenny, Jenny, Jenny
And I'm the king of having doubts
Jenny, Jenny, Jenny
But we can rule the world, girl
If we can find a way to come together
Jenny, Jenny, Jenny
Call me up, make it soon
No matter how you feel
Just call and tell me everything
Jenny, Jenny, Jenny
'Cause I can't live without you, girl
Can't you see that you're the only one for me
Jenny, Jenny, Jenny
I don't think you're alone
In giving love a bad name
Jenny, Jenny, Jenny
You're the queen of breakup stories
Jenny, Jenny, Jenny
And I'm the king of having doubts
Jenny, Jenny, Jenny
But we can rule the world, girl
If we can find a way to come together
Jenny, Jenny, Jenny
Call me up, make it soon
No matter how you feel
Just call and tell me everything
Jenny, Jenny, Jenny
I can't live without you, girl
Can't you see that you're the only one for me
