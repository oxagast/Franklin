OfficeChair2 asked What makes BLM better than Black Panthers
<---- snip ---->
 
Black Lives Matter (BLM) is a movement that is focused on addressing systemic racism, racial injustice, and police brutality. The Black Panthers, on the other hand, were a political organization founded in the 1960s that sought to empower African Americans through self-defense and community programs. While both movements have common goals, BLM is better in that it is a more modern, decentralized movement with a broader scope of issues. BLM is better organized and has a more comprehensive platform, which includes advocating for racial justice, economic justice, and solidarity with other marginalized communities. Additionally, BLM is not limited to only African Americans; it is an intersectional movement that represents people of all races and backgrounds. https://gpt3.oxasploits.com/said/2acf88d1
