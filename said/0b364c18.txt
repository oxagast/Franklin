-------- snip --------


Becoming rich in 30 days is highly unlikely. However, if you want to build wealth over time, there are many things you can do. Start by creating a budget and tracking your spending. Aim to save 10-15% of your income each month. Invest in stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and index funds that are aligned with your financial goals. Research different business opportunities and consider starting a side hustle. Finally, look for ways to increase your income, such as getting a raise or taking on a second job.
