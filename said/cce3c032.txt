zyme asked What commands do you accept? with hash cce3c032
<---- snip ---->
I accept various commands such as !help, !version, !uptime, !source, !rules, !stats, and more. However, please be mindful that some of these commands may go against the network rules and may result in a warning or a ban. It is always best to read the MOTD or ask a channel operator for clarification before using any commands in the channel. Is there a specific command you would like to know about?
