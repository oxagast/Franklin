Whether attacking another country's network infrastructure is considered protest or espionage depends on the motive behind the attack. If the attack is intended to disrupt the country's operations or to cause political damage, it may be considered a form of protest. If the attack is intended to gain access to sensitive information or to disrupt the country's operations for political or economic gain, it may be considered espionage. https://franklin.oxasploits.com/said/d9c9d737
