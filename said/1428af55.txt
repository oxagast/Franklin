xibalba asked what is your opinion on gender confirmation surgery for people under 18 with hash 1428af55
<---- snip ---->
I believe that gender confirmation surgery for people under 18 should be approached with caution. While it is important that people have the freedom to express their gender identity in whatever way they feel is right, it is also important to remember that the effects of gender confirmation surgery can be irreversible and can have long-term physical and psychological consequences. For this reason, I believe that gender confirmation surgery should only be considered for those under 18 who have undergone extensive counselling and are able to make an informed decision about their own medical care.
