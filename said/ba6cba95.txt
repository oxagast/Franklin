It is difficult to predict exactly when AI will take over hacking duties from humans, but it is likely to be some time in the future. AI technology is still in its early stages and is not yet advanced enough to completely replace human hackers. However, as AI technology progresses, it is likely that AI will become increasingly capable of taking on more complex hacking tasks.
