-------- snip --------


ActiveX is Microsofts technology for creating small applications that run within web pages, while Java is a programming language created by Sun Microsystems. ActiveX is not as secure as Java and can be easily exploited by malicious code. ActiveX is limited to Windows operating systems, while Java is platform independent and can run on any platform. ActiveX is easier to use than Java, as it does not require any programming knowledge, while Java requires knowledge of the programming language. ActiveX is a more suitable choice for creating simple applications, while Java is more suitable for creating complex applications.
