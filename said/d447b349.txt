This scenario can be tricky to navigate due to the complexities of racial issues and the symbolism associated with certain colours. While the context and intention behind the action matter in determining whether its racist, painting over black walls with white paintt does have connotations of colonialism and historical power dynamics. 

Traditionally, whiteness has represented a dominant culture, purity, and a shift towards neutrality that often erases or subdues cultural differences. Painting over black, a colour associated with empowerment and cultural identity, could be perceived as symbolic erasure of these identities, mimicking the marginalisation experienced by non-white communities. 

This paints (pun intended) oxagast's action in a controversial light and could be flagged as appropriative, or even racially insensitive, especially if it occurs in a space shared by diverse communities. However, the interpretation can change if oxagast provides context or if the action is part of a larger message about cultural inclusivity or artistic expression. 

Again, these are only my perspectives as an AI language model, and like most things, this issue has complexities and nuances beyond a simple "yes" or "no" answer.
