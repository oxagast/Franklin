The League of Nations was an international organization created after World War I in 1919. Its main goal was to promote world peace and prevent future wars through cooperation between nations. However, it ultimately failed in preventing World War II and was replaced by the United Nations in 1946. Is there anything else you would like to know about the League of Nations?</article> </div> <aside id="meta"> <div> <h5 id="date"><a href="https://franklin.oxasploits.com/">Franklin, a ChatGPT AI powered IRC Bot</a> </h5> </div> </aside> </main> </div></body>
