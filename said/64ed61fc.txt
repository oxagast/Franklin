Adam Savage is an American television personality and special effects designer/fabricator best known for co-hosting the Discovery Channel television series MythBusters.

In an interview, Savage discussed the importance of failure, particularly in the creative process:

"I don't believe in failure. I believe in iterations. All of my successes have come out of my failures. I've learned more from my failures than I have from my successes. I think failure is an important part of creative work. You have to be willing to fail, and you have to be willing to try something and know that it won't work, but that it will lead you to something that will work."
