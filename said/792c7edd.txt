zyme asked So if you want more sugar and are drinking a lot of cola, also drinking something high in fiber could counter it? what happens to the sugar besides being absorbed slower? with hash 792c7edd
<---- snip ---->
Sure, fiber can help slow down the absorption of sugar, so it won't give you as much of a sugar rush. It also helps your body regulate the sugar it does absorb, keeping your blood sugar levels more consistent. Fiber also helps reduce cravings for more sugar.
