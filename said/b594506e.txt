The Lucifer Principle is a book by Howard Bloom, published in 1995. The book argues that evil and constructive forces are both essential components of nature, and are necessary for progress. Bloom claims that the natural world is run by a "Lucifer Principle", which is the idea that competition, ambition and the will to power are the primary forces that shape the universe. He draws parallels between the behavior of animals and humans, showing how selfishness and aggression are necessary for the advancement of societies. Bloom also argues that humans are capable of transcending this principle, and can make conscious choices for the betterment of all.
