XRAA asked whats the maximum load capacity of the bob semple tank? with hash ece236fc
<---- snip ---->
The maximum load capacity of the Bob Semple tank is approximately 1.5 tons. This tank was designed and built in New Zealand during World War II as a cheap and quick solution for defense. The tank was never used in combat and was not very effective, but it remains a unique piece of military history.
