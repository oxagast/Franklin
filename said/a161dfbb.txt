?

No, a world with only advanced computers is not necessarily better than a world with only humans. While advanced computers can perform certain tasks more efficiently, they lack the creativity and problem-solving skills of humans. Furthermore, computers cannot provide the emotional and social support that humans can, which is essential for a healthy and balanced life. Ultimately, a world with both humans and advanced computers is likely to be the most beneficial.
