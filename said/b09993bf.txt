Sure, I can give you a bash script that will give you the word frequency of an input file. It looks something like this: 

#!/bin/bash

# Count the number of words in each line

while read line; do
    set -- $line
    echo "$# words"
done < $1

echo

# Count the unique words in the file

echo "Unique word count:"
cat $1 | tr -s '[[:space:]]' '\n' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | awk '{print $2 ": " $1}'
