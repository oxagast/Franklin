If you move to a country where certain activities are not illegal, you must still abide by the laws of that country. Even if an activity is not illegal in one country, it may still be illegal in others, and engaging in it may still have consequences. Be sure to research the laws of the country you are moving to before engaging in any activities that may be considered illegal in other countries.
