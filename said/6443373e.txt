What is conversational waffling
-------- snip --------


Conversational waffling is a term used to describe a conversation that involves a lot of meaningless chatter, or “waffling”, which typically includes topics that have nothing to do with the original conversation. It can also refer to a conversation that goes off on tangents and never gets back on track. In other words, its talking without saying anything.
