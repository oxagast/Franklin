<h2>Franklin</h2>
<br><i>Sat May  6 23:32:40 2023<br>Tokens used: 312<br>Avg cost: $0.00624<br></i><br><br><br><b>bookworm</b> asked: <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp what are the statistics for people who win lotteries? Do they then lead happy wonderful lives after or commit suicide?<br><br> <br><br>Franklin: That's a great question, bookworm! According to a study by the National Endowment for Financial Education, 83% of lottery winners were happy with their winnings three years after they won. However, the study also found that more than 70% of lottery winners reported increased stress levels related to their winnings. As for whether or not lottery winners are more likely to commit suicide after their winnings, the study found no correlation. So while winning the lottery may not necessarily guarantee a "happy ever after" life, it doesn't seem to be associated with more risk of suicide either.
