zyme asked Who was the last sameri? with hash 4a0c3939
<---- snip ---->
My best guess is that the last Sameri is someone who was in the IRC channel #2600 recently. If you need more information, you can search for their username on https://franklin.oxasploits.com/. If that doesn't yield any useful results, you might want to check the channel logs or ask the channel operators.
