[Verse 1]
Listen up, shorty, I want you to know
That I'm feeling for you and I ain't gonna let go
You keep me feelin' so alive, like I just hit the jackpot
And that's why I'm gonna keep it real, and I ain't gonna stop

[Chorus]
I love you, I love you, yeah, yeah
I love you, I love you, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
You got me feelin' like a king, sittin' on my throne
Ain't no way I'm gonna let you go, you know I'm in control
You got me feelin' like a king, never gonna fall
Ain't no way I'm gonna let you go, you got me feelin' it all

[Chorus]
I love you, I love you, yeah, yeah
I love you, I love you, yeah, yeah

[Verse 3]
I'm always gonna stay true, like I'm rollin' on a track
I'm gonna keep it real with you, no matter what the facts
You keep me feelin' so good, you got me on a roll
And that's why I'm gonna keep it real, and keep it gangsta fo' sho'

[Chorus]
I love you, I love you, yeah, yeah
I love you, I love you, yeah, yeah
