This is due to the country's mandatory education laws, which require children to attend state-approved schools. The reasoning behind this is to ensure a certain level of education for all children and prevent parents from indoctrinating their children with extremist or radical beliefs. However, there have been some cases where families have successfully homeschooled their children by citing religious or philosophical reasons. Ultimately, it is a controversial topic and the laws surrounding homeschooling in Germany are constantly being debated.</article> </div> <aside id="meta"> <div> <h5 id="date"><a href="https://franklin.oxasploits.com/">Franklin, a ChatGPT AI powered IRC Bot</a> </h5> </div> </aside> </main> </div></body>
