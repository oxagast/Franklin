CerebraNet asked How can I make marshmallows with hash cfb78dd1
<---- snip ---->
To make marshmallows, mix 3 parts of unflavored gelatin with 1 part cold water and let it sit for a few minutes. In the meantime, combine 1 cup of granulated sugar, 1/3 cup of light corn syrup, and 1/4 teaspoon of salt in a medium-sized saucepan. Heat the mixture until the sugar dissolves, then turn off the heat and add the gelatin mixture. Stir until it's completely combined, then pour the mixture into a greased 9x13-inch baking dish and chill until the marshmallows are firm. Cut them into squares and enjoy!
