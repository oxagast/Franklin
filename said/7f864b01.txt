There is no single answer to this question. Different religious traditions view the actions of God, and His relationship to evil, in different ways. Some believe that God allows evil to exist in order to test people's faith, while others believe that God has a specific plan that involves a certain amount of evil in order to achieve a greater good. Ultimately, there is no single answer to this question and any answer to this question is a matter of personal religious belief.
