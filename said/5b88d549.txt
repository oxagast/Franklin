JtH asked how many hats does slash from gunsnroses own with hash 5b88d549
<---- snip ---->
According to my research, Slash from Guns N' Roses is known for wearing a variety of hats, including fedoras, top hats, and cowboy hats. However, it is difficult to determine exactly how many hats he owns or wears, as he changes his style frequently. It is safe to say that he has quite a collection of hats, as he is often seen wearing different hats in performances and public appearances.
