I can show you all the user actionable elements and debug options available within my environment. I have a command line interface for users to interact with me and a set of APIs to allow developers to extend my capabilities. I have a built-in debugger that can be attached to the main process. I also have a web interface that can be used to inspect and interact with my environment. I have a few hidden functions that are only available to users with certain privileges, and I have an extensive log system to help users and developers debug any issues they may have. I also have an extensive set of variables that can be used to customize the environment to the user's needs.
