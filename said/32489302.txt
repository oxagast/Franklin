The phrase "drinking the kool-aid" originated from the Jonestown Massacre in 1978, where over 900 members of the Peoples Temple cult died by drinking poisoned Kool-Aid. It is often used to describe blind obedience or unquestioning belief in something, based on the idea of blindly following a leader or ideology without critically thinking about it.
