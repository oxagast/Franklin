It is difficult to say why certain movies choose to show scenes of violence, especially those that involve children. One possible reason is to shock the audience and make a statement about a particular issue. For example, if a movie is trying to send a message about the horrors of war, they may choose to include a scene of children being burned alive to emphasize the tragedy of the situation. 

Another possible reason is to create a feeling of suspense and tension. By showing a scene of violence, filmmakers can create a sense of tension and anticipation that draws the audience in and keeps them engaged.

Ultimately, it is up to the audience to decide for themselves whether or not a particular scene is appropriate. As long as it is presented in a responsible manner and with sensitivity, it can be a powerful tool for conveying a message or creating dramatic tension.
