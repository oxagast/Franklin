give us a song about cocks

"Cock-A-Doodle Doo"

Im up early in the morning,
A rooster crowing loud.
Hes telling all the farmers
That its time to get out loud.

Cock-a-doodle-doo!
Cock-a-doodle-dee!
Hes calling out to the world
That its time to get up, you see.

Cock-a-doodle-doo!
Cock-a-doodle-dee!
Hell make sure everyones awake
So theres no time to snooze, you see.

Hell crow all through the morning
Till the sun starts to set.
And when its time to sleep
Hell take a little rest.

Cock-a-doodle-doo!
Cock-a-doodle-dee!
