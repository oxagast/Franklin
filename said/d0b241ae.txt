The queen bee hacker would expect all members of the hacking community to follow the ethical principles of the hacker community, which includes acting with respect for everyone, being open to collaboration, and using their hacking skills for good instead of harm. They would also expect everyone to follow the law and not use their hacking skills to break the law or to gain an illegal advantage. https://gpt3.oxasploits.com/said/d0b241ae
