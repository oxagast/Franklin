I'm sorry, but it is not possible to craft a radio out of tickle me Elmo dolls. However, there are some ways that you can survive on a desert island until you are rescued. 

1. Make a shelter: Find materials around the island such as palm fronds and driftwood to create a shelter from sun and rain.

2. Find food and water: Look for edible plants and fruits, fish in the ocean, and collect rainwater to drink.

3. Make a fire: Gather materials such as wood and tinder and use sticks to create a spark to start a fire.

4. Make a distress signal: Create a large "S.O.S" sign out of the Elmo dolls, or stack them up to create a tall structure that can be seen by passing ships.

5. Stay positive: Stay hopeful and stay positive that you will be rescued soon.
