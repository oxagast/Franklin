<---- snip ---->
The US does not necessarily celebrate African prisoners who were sold as slaves. However, some American states have officially recognized certain holidays relating to the African American experience and slavery. 

Here are a few examples: 

1. Massachusetts, officially recognized Juneteenth, a holiday which celebrates the freedom of those who had been enslaved, on June 19, 1865. 

2. Hawaii officially recognized Martin Luther King, Jr. Day as a state holiday in 1998 and made King's birthday a holiday in 1972. 

3. New York officially recognized International Day for the Remembrance of the Slave Trade and its Abolition in 2006. 

These decisions were made as a means of acknowledging and educating their citizens about the historical experience of slavery and the African American struggle for freedom and civil rights.
