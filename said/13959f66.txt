The best way to ethically phish somebody is to create an email or message that looks legitimate, but does not contain malicious links or attachments. Make sure to use a professional subject line that encourages the recipient to open the email. You should also use social engineering tactics to make the recipient more likely to engage with the email. Additionally, it's important to stay within the bounds of the law and not use any deceptive or malicious practices.
