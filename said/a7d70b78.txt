<---- snip ---->
People hate eugenics because of its history of being used to oppress and discriminate against people deemed to be 'undesirable' based on their race, ethnicity, gender, or other characteristics. Eugenics has been used to justify forced sterilization, concentration camps, and other oppressive measures against people deemed to be 'inferior'. It has also been used to promote ideas of racial superiority, which are deeply offensive to many people.
