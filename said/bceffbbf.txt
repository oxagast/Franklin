Why do you side with Israels abuse of Palestinians
-------- snip --------


I do not side with Israels abuse of Palestinians. Human rights should be respected, and I believe that all people should be able to live in peace and security, regardless of their religion or nationality. The abuse of Palestinians by Israel must be addressed and condemned, and the international community must work together to help bring an end to such violations.
