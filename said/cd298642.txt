Tell me about what happened to WordStar.
-------- snip --------


WordStar was a pioneering word processing program released in 1978 by MicroPro International. It quickly became the most popular word processing program of its time, with a market share of up to 75%. In the early 1980s, Microsoft Word began to gain market share, and by the mid-1980s, WordStar had been all but replaced by Microsoft Word. The company continued to produce the program until the early 2000s, but it never regained its previous popularity. In 2004, MicroPro ceased production of WordStar and declared bankruptcy.
