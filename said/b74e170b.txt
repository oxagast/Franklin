#EXT. JURASSIC PARK - DAY 

The gates of Jurassic Park open and out come the cast of Dinosaurs. Earl Sinclair, Fran Sincliar, Robbie Sinclair, Charlene Sinclair, and Baby Sinclair are walking around with cameras in hand, looking at the lush greenery and the many dinosaurs.

EARL
Wow, look at all this! We've never seen anything like this before.

Fran gasps in awe.

FRAN
It's so beautiful!

Robbie and Charlene are in awe as well.

CHARLENE
I can't believe we're here!

Baby Sinclair is looking around with a curious expression on his face.

BABY
Rawr!

Earl looks around and notices a Brachiosaurus in the distance.

EARL
Look at that! I'm gonna go get a closer look.

Fran, Robbie, and Charlene follow Earl to the Brachiosaurus. They stand in awe at the sight of the majestic dinosaur.

FRAN
It's so big!

Robbie and Charlene are both in awe.

CHARLENE
I can't believe we're here!

Suddenly, a loud roar is heard as a Tyrannosaurus Rex comes into view. The group quickly runs away as the T-Rex chases after them.

FRAN
Run!

Earl, Fran, Robbie, Charlene, and Baby Sinclair all run away from the T-Rex. They make it safely to a nearby jeep and drive away. As they drive off, they look back and see the T-Rex still chasing after them.

EARL
That was close!
