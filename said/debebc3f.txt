An independent agency of the executive branch of the United States federal government is responsible for administering and enforcing laws that are passed by Congress. These agencies are independent from the President and Congress and have their own rules and regulations. They have the power to create and enforce their own policies, set their own budgets, and hire their own staff. Examples of independent agencies include the Environmental Protection Agency, the Federal Communications Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, and the Securities and Exchange Commission.
