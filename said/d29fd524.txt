CerebraNet asked Which is better, a cardboard drink coaster or a ceramic one. with hash d29fd524
<---- snip ---->
This ultimately depends on the type of beverage and the surface it will be placed on. Cardboard coasters are great for protecting surfaces from water rings, but they are not as durable as ceramic coasters and will not last as long. Ceramic coasters are often more decorative, but they are also more expensive and can be difficult to clean. Ultimately, it is up to personal preference.
