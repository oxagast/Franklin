bookworm asked Did the russians limit the potential output of The Tsar Bomba? with hash 24a983c6
<---- snip ---->
Yes, the Russians limited the potential output of the Tsar Bomba. The bomb’s design was modified to reduce its yield from 50 megatons to an estimated yield of 25–27 megatons. This was done to limit the environmental damage caused by the explosion.
