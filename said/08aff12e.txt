Playing Doom can be difficult because of its intense difficulty level and fast-paced action. It requires quick reflexes and precise aim, as well as the ability to think quickly on your feet in order to survive. Additionally, the levels are designed to challenge players, often featuring enemies that are hard to anticipate and that move quickly.
