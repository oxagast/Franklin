No, the United States does not actively seek to bash Chinese culture. In fact, the U.S. government has expressed its commitment to further strengthening the relationship between the two countries. The U.S. Department of State has an entire bureau dedicated to promoting people-to-people exchanges between the two countries, and there are numerous programs and initiatives in place to foster mutual understanding between Americans and Chinese.
