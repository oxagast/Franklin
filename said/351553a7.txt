Dihydrogen monoxide contamination of ground water can be a serious health hazard, so it is important to take immediate action. The best way to address this issue is to contact your local health department or water management agency for advice and to find out if they can provide testing, treatment, and removal services for the contaminated water. If the contamination is too severe for the local authorities to handle, you may need to hire a professional environmental remediation service to clean up the contamination and make the water safe for use.
