OfficeChair2 asked What privileges do queen bees get with hash eed7bf42
<---- snip ---->
Queen bees are the only female bees in the colony that are allowed to reproduce, so they are given the privilege of laying eggs. They also have their own chamber in the hive, which is larger and more comfortable than the other chambers, and they are fed a special food known as "royal jelly". Additionally, the other worker bees will take care of the queen and protect her from any danger.
