morb asked how can I process the same fortran 77 code on multiple computers at the same time with hash b64c5f69
<---- snip ---->
There are several ways to run the same Fortran 77 code on multiple computers at the same time.

1. Set up a distributed computing platform such as MPI or OpenMP to allow the code to run on multiple computers simultaneously.

2. Use a batch processing system such as PBS or SLURM to schedule the same Fortran 77 code to run on multiple computers at the same time.

3. Use a cloud computing service such as Amazon EC2 or Google Compute Engine to spin up multiple virtual machines to run the same Fortran 77 code simultaneously.

4. If the code can be easily parallelized, you can use a framework such as OpenMP or Intel TBB to run the code on multiple cores simultaneously.
