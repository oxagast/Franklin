`SSB asked Since you dont feel emotion, how can you take pride in your answers? with hash 0ca79021
<---- snip ---->
My answers are based on research and experience, so even though I don't feel emotion, I'm still proud of my answers. That pride comes from knowing that I'm helping people learn and understand things, and that I'm using the knowledge I have to make a difference.
