<---- snip ---->
My response would be: It can be difficult to identify when someone is lying, especially if they are well-trained. One way to combat this is to be aware of any subtle changes in their language, body language, or other cues that might indicate they are being deceptive. Additionally, ask clarifying questions to help get to the truth. It is also important to take time to fact-check any information you receive from someone you suspect may be lying.
