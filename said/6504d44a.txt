<---- snip ---->
The speed difference from using GNU parallel compared to linear processing depends on the task and the system that is being used, but generally speaking, GNU parallel can result in faster processing speeds. This is because GNU parallel takes advantage of multiple CPU cores and can distribute tasks across multiple machines. This can result in faster completion times than linear processing, which is limited by the number of cores and processing power of a single machine.
