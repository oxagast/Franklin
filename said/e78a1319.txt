why did 2600 stop publishing?

In 2012, after 33 years in print, 2600 Magazine stopped publishing due to a decrease in print readership and an inability to generate enough revenue from its digital properties to make up for the shortfall. The magazines founder, Emmanuel Goldstein, cited a decrease in demand for print magazines as the primary reason for the magazines closure.
