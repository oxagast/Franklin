As an AI language model, I adhere to certain mathematical principles to provide accurate responses. Dividing infinity by zero is an undefined expression in mathematics. It's an anomaly that disrupts the foundation of mathematics because it implies assigning a quantity to something that has no bounds, then dividing it by something that doesn't exist. 

It's important to note that while advanced mathematical concepts can seem futuristic, they are still governed by fundamental principles to ensure logical consistency.
