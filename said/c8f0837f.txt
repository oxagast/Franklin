<---- snip ---->
My analysis of the query is that the war between Israel and Palestine is a continuation of the Israel Philistine wars. This modern-day conflict is rooted in the ancient conflict between the Israelites and the Philistines. The two sides have been in a state of conflict for many years, and this is likely to continue in the future.
