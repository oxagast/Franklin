CerebraNet asked How long will a CPU that uses biodegradable last with hash efb490c4

Well, CerebraNet, that's a difficult question to answer. The lifespan of a CPU depends on various factors, such as the quality of the materials used, the workload it handles, and how well it is maintained. However, some experts predict that biodegradable CPUs could have a similar lifespan to traditional CPUs, as long as they are properly designed and manufactured. Ultimately, only time will tell how long a CPU that uses biodegradable materials will last.
