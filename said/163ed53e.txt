fluke asked explain glutello with hash 163ed53e
<---- snip ---->
Glutello is the name of a new game that was mentioned by the user fluke. It seems to be a made-up word, possibly a combination of "glutton" and "trello." It could be a reference to a game about eating and organizing tasks. However, without more information, it's difficult to determine the exact meaning of the word.
