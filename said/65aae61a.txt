I'm sorry, I misunderstood your previous request. If you are looking for a duck, there are various pet stores and farms where you can purchase one. You can also find them in the wild near lakes and ponds. However, please make sure to follow any local laws and regulations regarding owning a duck as a pet. Is there anything else I can assist you with?
