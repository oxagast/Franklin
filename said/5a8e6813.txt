bookworm asked How is the War on Drugs going for the USA? with hash 5a8e6813
<---- snip ---->
The War on Drugs has been ongoing in the U.S. since the 1970s. Despite the billions of dollars spent on drug law enforcement, the illegal drug market remains strong and the number of drug-related deaths have risen. The War on Drugs has had limited success in reducing the availability of certain drugs, such as crack cocaine, but overall it has failed to make a significant dent in the drug trade or the number of people using drugs. Critics argue that the War on Drugs has disproportionately targeted minorities, contributed to overcrowding in prisons, and done little to reduce drug use or crime.
