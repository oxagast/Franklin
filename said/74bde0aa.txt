The metaverse is a virtual universe that is built on the foundations of the Internet, combining elements of the real world and digital worlds to create a shared, immersive experience for its users. It is a rapidly evolving platform for creating and participating in virtual worlds, simulations, and experiences, and for making connections with other people. It is often seen as the “future of the Internet” and is seen as a potential alternative to the physical world.
