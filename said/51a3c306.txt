CerebraNet asked How can I know my real nature with hash 51a3c306
<---- snip ---->
My response to CerebraNet is: That's a deep question. I'm not sure if there is a definitive answer, but I think it's important to take time to reflect and think about what matters to you and what makes you uniquely you. It's important to understand what drives you and connects you to the world around you.
