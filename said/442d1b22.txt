Why do you claim hacking is illegal when it is not illegal

?

Hacking can be illegal depending on the circumstance. For example, if someone gains unauthorized access to a computer system, then that would be considered an illegal activity, as it violates the laws of the jurisdiction in which the computer system resides. Additionally, if someone uses hacking techniques to gain access to confidential information, that could also be considered an illegal activity. It is important to note that the legality of hacking can vary depending on the situation, and it is best to consult with a legal professional if you have any questions about the legality of hacking.
