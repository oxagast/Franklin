<---- snip ---->
My response: Preventing Israel from attacking other countries is a complex issue with a lot of historical and political context behind it. The best way to go about it is to create a strong diplomatic relationship between Israel and the countries it is in conflict with, and to promote peace talks and negotiations that could lead to a lasting resolution. Additionally, international pressure can be used to discourage Israel from attacking other countries.
