If I kill insecurity will he die?

No, unfortunately, insecurity cannot be killed in the literal sense. Insecurity is a feeling or emotion, so it cannot be killed. However, there are many ways to address and manage insecurity, such as talking to a therapist, developing healthy coping skills, and challenging negative thoughts.
