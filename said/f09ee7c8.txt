Write a poem about dog and butterfly
-------- snip --------


A loyal pup and a gentle flutter,
A friendship formed between the two
The pup, a furry bundle of fur,
The butterfly, a beauty in blue.

The pup and butterfly, they play
Frolicking in the meadow so green
The pup, a pup of joy and love
The butterfly, a sight to be seen.

The pup, so loyal and true
The butterfly, so gentle and kind
The pup, so sweet, so full of joy
The butterfly, so soft and light.

The pup and the butterfly,
Two of the best of friends
The pup, so loyal and faithful
The butterfly, so graceful and gentle.
