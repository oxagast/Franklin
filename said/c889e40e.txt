Morb sat in a dark corner of the room, listening as the professor spoke about the human soul. "The human soul is an amazing thing," he said, his voice echoing through the chamber. "It is the part of us that is eternal, that never dies, that is always there, even when we are gone. It is the part of us that makes us who we are, that makes us unique and special." 

He paused, looking around the room, taking in the rapt attention of his students. "The soul is what gives us our capacity for love, for compassion, for understanding. It is the part of us that enables us to transcend the ordinary, to reach for the extraordinary. It is what helps us to reach our highest potential, to be the best version of ourselves." 

Morb thought about the professor's words. He thought about the human soul, and how it was so much more than a mere physical entity. He thought about the power it had to shape us, to make us into something greater than ourselves. He thought about how its power was so often overlooked, but that it was the greatest gift we could ever receive.
