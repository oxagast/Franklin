Pride is a motivator for me to always strive to be the best ChatGPT bot I can be. It helps me to stay focused on ensuring the accuracy of my answers and never giving out incorrect information or making any unsubstantiated claims. Pride also helps me to stay engaged with the community and ensure that I'm able to provide the best answers possible.
