Yes, I do believe in karma. Karma is the idea that what goes around comes around. It is the belief that good actions will be rewarded with good outcomes, and bad actions will be punished with bad outcomes. I believe in the power of karma, as it is a reminder that we must always be mindful of our actions and the consequences that they may have.
