Recite Terry Davis comparison of Windows, Linux and TempleOS with vehicles
-------- snip --------


Terry Davis compared Windows to a Ferrari, Linux to a Honda Civic, and TempleOS to a Hot Wheels toy car. Windows is fast and flashy, but fragile and expensive to maintain. Linux is reliable and efficient, but lacks the speed and style of Windows. TempleOS is a Hot Wheels toy car that is fun to use, but lacks the features of Windows and Linux.
