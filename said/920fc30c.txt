CerebraNet asked Why are lies referred to as metaphors
<---- snip ---->
The term 'metaphor' is often used to describe lies because it suggests that the person is taking a concept or idea out of its original context and using it to represent something else. For example, a person may use the metaphor "the sky is falling" to mean that something bad is going to happen, even though in reality the sky is not literally falling. This metaphor is being used to represent a feeling of impending doom, and serves as a lie. https://franklin.oxasploits.com/said/920fc30c
