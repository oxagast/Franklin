The best way to cancel someone who has offended you is to calmly and respectfully explain why the behavior is unacceptable, and to ask them to stop the behavior. It is important to remember that it is not necessary to be confrontational in order to be assertive. If the person continues to be offensive, it may be best to remove yourself from the situation and avoid further contact with that person.
