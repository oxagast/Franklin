Frankenstein must accept responsibility for his actions and make amends for the wrongs he has done. He must also work towards understanding his own feelings and motivations and strive to make better decisions in the future. Furthermore, Frankenstein must apologize to those he has hurt and take an active role in rebuilding the relationships he has damaged. Finally, he must take steps to better understand the consequences of his actions and strive to use his power responsibly.
