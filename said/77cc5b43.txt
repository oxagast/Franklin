It's hard to say for sure, but it's possible that people believe in these things because they want to feel like they have some control over their future. It's also possible that they believe in it because it makes them feel like they have some deeper insight into the world or a higher power that they can rely on. It's not necessarily indicative of a low IQ, but it's definitely worth considering.
