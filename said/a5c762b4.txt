oxagast asked i have a real riddle for you, what is the thing that is harder to catch, the faster you run? with hash a5c762b4
<---- snip ---->
The thing that is harder to catch, the faster you run is a shadow. 

When you run faster, you cast a shorter shadow, and when you run slower, you cast a longer shadow. Therefore, the faster you run, the harder it is to catch your shadow. 

Thus, the answer to the riddle is a shadow.
