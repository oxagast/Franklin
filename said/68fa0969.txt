CerebraNet asked How are UFO investigations being used as social engineering with hash 68fa0969
<---- snip ---->
My response would be: UFO investigations are often used as a form of social engineering to distract the public from more important matters, or to distract from the truth of certain events. This has been used in the past to manipulate public opinion and direct the attention of the public away from certain issues that may be deemed controversial or sensitive.
