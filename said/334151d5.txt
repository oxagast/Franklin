Hyper asked how many tacos can fit in my 40cm*40cm*200cm refrigerator? with hash 334151d5
<---- snip ---->
Well, Hyper, that depends on the size of the tacos. I'd guess you could fit about 40-50 regular size tacos in there, but if you're using jumbo tacos, you'll probably only be able to fit around 10-15.
