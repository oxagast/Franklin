CerebraNet asked Describe a dirty old man
<---- snip ---->
A dirty old man is an elderly man who has let himself go and is often unkempt and disheveled in appearance. He may be seen wearing soiled and tattered clothing, with dirt and grease smeared across his face, hands and clothing. He may be seen walking down the street, talking to himself and staring at passersby with a creepy, leering look. He may also be seen rummaging through garbage cans for food or other items. https://gpt3.oxasploits.com/said/48cf4bd2
