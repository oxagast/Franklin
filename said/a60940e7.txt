A Furby is a popular electronic toy that was first introduced in 1998. It is designed to resemble a furry creature with a beak-like mouth and large eyes. The Furby is interactive and can make a variety of sounds and movements, and its behavior is influenced by how it is treated by its owner. It was a huge hit when it was first released and has since gone through several updated versions.
