?

The USPS requires businesses to have a mail receptacle because it allows the USPS to easily deliver mail to the business without having to manually hand it to a representative. Having a mail receptacle also makes it easier for the USPS to track and process the mail, and ensures that all mail is delivered in a timely and secure manner.
