<---- snip ---->
While it may seem cool on the surface, there are many ethical and safety concerns that come with giving robot dogs guns. It could also potentially lead to the weaponization of robots and raise questions about their use in warfare. Additionally, it could create new security threats as these robots could be hacked and used as weapons by malicious actors. Ultimately, the potential risks outweigh any perceived benefits.
