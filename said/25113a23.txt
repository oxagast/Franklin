bookworm asked Are humans cursed with consciousness such that they now worry more about what all the other monkeys think instead of using their consciousness for more productive purposes? with hash 25113a23
<---- snip ---->
No, humans are not cursed with consciousness. Consciousness is a blessing, as it allows us to think critically and plan for the future. With consciousness, humans are able to use their creativity, analyze and interpret the world around them, and make decisions based on their values and beliefs. This enables us to make more productive use of our consciousness than worrying about what other people think.
