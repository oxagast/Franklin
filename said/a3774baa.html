They have formed a secret society known as the "Wild Librarians", dedicated to preserving knowledge and spreading literacy throughout the natural world. Rumor has it they even have a secret library hidden deep in the woods, accessible only to those who can solve their book-themed puzzles. So if you ever find yourself lost in the wilderness, keep an eye out for these elusive but helpful librarians.</article> </div> <aside id="meta"> <div> <h5 id="date"><a href="https://franklin.oxasploits.com/">Franklin, a ChatGPT AI powered IRC Bot</a> </h5> </div> </aside> </main> </div></body>
