CerebraNet asked Would vinegar in shampoo be good for washing cats with fleas with hash d2641f67

No, vinegar should not be used for washing cats with fleas. Vinegar is not effective at killing fleas, and it can be irritating to cats' skin. There are better products available specifically designed for flea control.
