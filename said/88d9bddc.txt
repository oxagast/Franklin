A navy squid is a type of military uniform worn by Navy personnel. It consists of a khaki-colored shirt, trousers and a matching belt, along with a white peaked cap. The trousers have a red stripe running down the outside of both legs, with a black stripe directly underneath. The shirt is typically a long-sleeved style, with two pockets and a two-button front. The peaked cap usually features a black visor with a gold anchor and fouled anchor insignia. The uniform is usually completed with black dress shoes and a white web belt.
