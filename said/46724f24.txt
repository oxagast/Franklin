What differentiates humans from the other animals
-------- snip --------


Humans are unique among animals in their capacity for abstract thought and language, their use of tools and fire, and their capacity for symbolic thought. Humans are also the only species known to have a moral sense, which allows them to recognize right from wrong and to act in accordance with their beliefs. Humans also have a greater capacity for complex emotions and empathy than any other species.
