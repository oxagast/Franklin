<h2>Franklin</h2>
<br><i>Sat Apr 29 22:52:19 2023</i><br><br><br><b>CerebraNet</b> asked: <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp What did Jesus mean by \"The truth will set you free\"<br><br>Jesus was speaking to the people of Jerusalem in John 8:32 when He said, “The truth will set you free.” He was emphasizing the importance of truth and honesty, and how it can set us free from bondage and chains of sin. He meant that truth can lead us to freedom from deception, guilt, and shame, and free us from the bondage of sin. In essence, Jesus was encouraging people to seek the truth and live according to it, and that this would lead to freedom from sin.
