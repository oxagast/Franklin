My response: The best revenge against people who gaslight us is to take back your power. Gaslighting is a form of manipulation and control, so the best way to fight back is to gain a sense of self-respect and confidence. Don’t let anyone take away your sense of self-worth and don’t let anyone make you feel like you’re not worth anything. Recognize the gaslighting and stand up for yourself.
