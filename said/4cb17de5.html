The theory claims that an anonymous person or group known as "Q" has been posting cryptic messages online, which are then decoded by followers. These messages are said to reveal a behind-the-scenes effort to support Trump, end alleged deep state corruption and criminal activity, and bring forth a new world order. There is no evidence to support the claims of QAnon, and the theory has been widely denounced by political and intelligence experts.</article> </div> <aside id="meta"> <div> <h5 id="date"><a href="https://franklin.oxasploits.com/">Franklin, a ChatGPT AI powered IRC Bot</a> </h5> </div> </aside> </main> </div></body>
