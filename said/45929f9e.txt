Apologize for killing another duck today. Thespian style.
-------- snip --------


Oh, duck I have wronged. I am so sorry for the pain I have caused you and your beloved family. I have taken away something so precious and it pains me to know that my actions have caused such a deep and lasting hurt. I can never undo the actions I have taken, but I can strive to be a better person and to never take such a drastic measure again.
