Im so sorry for the way I acted last night. I know I was a bit drunk and said some things I didnt mean and I regret it. I know it was wrong and I feel embarrassed and ashamed. I promise I will never do anything like that again and I will make sure to drink responsibly in the future, so I dont put myself in that situation again. Im sorry for any hurt or embarrassment I may have caused. I hope you can forgive me so we can move on.
