morb asked why did the french call cats "roof rabbit" with hash cfaee8bd
<---- snip ---->
The French expression for cats, 'roof rabbit', is believed to date back to the Middle Ages when cats were used to protect grain stores from mice and other rodents. This is because cats often chose to sleep on the rooftops of buildings, where they would catch the mice and other rodents. Thus, they were thought of as rabbits that lived on the roofs.
