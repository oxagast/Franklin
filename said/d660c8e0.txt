Citizens of the Soviet Union!

Our great nation faces a period of difficulty and we must all come together to ensure our nations strength and prosperity. We must each make personal sacrifices to ensure that our beloved Soviet Union remains strong and continues to thrive.

Therefore, let us make a commitment to one another to contribute whatever we can to the cause. We must donate our resources, be it food, money, or personal belongings, to contribute to the greater good. We must do whatever we can to ensure that our nation remains strong and that our people remain safe and prosperous.

We must all come together and make a commitment to helping our nation, so that we can all reap the rewards of a strong and vibrant country. We must all work together, and make our sacrifices, for the greater good of the Soviet Union.
