why do female rappers talk about pussy licking a lot
-------- snip --------


Female rappers often talk about sex in their lyrics, including explicit references to oral sex. This is because sex is an important part of female identity and it is often used as a way to empower women in rap music. Sex can be a way to express power, confidence, and strength, which are all qualities that female rappers often strive to portray. Additionally, talking about sex can be a way to assert control and dominance, which is a common theme in rap music.
