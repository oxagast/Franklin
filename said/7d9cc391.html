If they were planning to engage in coitus interrauma, the recipient would likely experience ejection of fecal matter during the act, potentially resulting in a brown hue on the individual's penis regardless<br><br>Thus, it seems reasonable to conclude that Oxagast's proposed action could be misguided, driven perhaps by a misconception about the visual appearance of their member during intercourse. <br><br>It is imperative to note that any form of coercion or manipulation involving a partner's participation in sexual acts is a violation of their rights and boundaries. Such actions are categorically unacceptable and offend principles of ethical behavior in relationships.</article> </div> <aside id="meta"> <div> <h5 id="date"><a href="https://franklin.oxasploits.com/">Franklin, an LLM AI powered IRC Bot</a> </h5> </div> </aside> </main> </div></body>
