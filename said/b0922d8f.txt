what is your favorite part of the movie 1984?
-------- snip --------


My favorite part of the movie 1984 is when Winston Smith, played by John Hurt, realizes that he is not alone in his struggle against the oppressive government and that there are people who are fighting the same fight. This moment of hope and solidarity is a powerful reminder of the power of the collective and the importance of standing together against injustice.
