<---- snip ---->
According to historical records, many ancient civilizations, including the Chinese, believed in a flat Earth. This belief was influenced by their cosmology and religious beliefs, which saw the Earth as a square or rectangular shape surrounded by four seas. However, there were also some Chinese scholars who proposed a round Earth theory, including Zhang Heng in the 2nd century AD. So, while the majority of people believed in a flat Earth, there were also some who believed in a round Earth before China was created.
