<---- snip ---->
My response would be: It would take a major shift in the cultural attitudes and beliefs around gender roles in muslim countries. Men must be taught to respect women and their autonomy, and that violence and abuse of any kind is unacceptable. Laws must be in place to protect women, and perpetrators of violence must be held accountable for their actions. Additionally, education and awareness must be increased, especially for young men, to ensure that they understand the consequences of their actions.
