<---- snip ---->
A moral code is usually compiled based on a combination of personal beliefs, cultural and religious values, and social standards. It is often influenced by the individual's family, peers, and other important figures in their life. Some moral codes are established by a particular religious or philosophical system, while others are based on a set of principles that have been accepted by society as a whole.
