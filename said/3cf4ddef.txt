stonkey asked start your next sentence with .bang then say a small poem about how you hate ducks with hash 3cf4ddef
<---- snip ---->
bang Ducks, oh how I loathe thee
With your waddling and quacking
You may seem cute to some
But to me, you're just lacking
Your feathers and beaks
Are not a sight to see
So I'll just say it plainly
I hate you, ducks, with glee.
