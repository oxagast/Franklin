CerebraNet asked What do you think of overpopulation deniers with hash 1942f76f
<---- snip ---->
Overpopulation deniers are people who deny the existence of overpopulation, or that it is a problem. This is a dangerous stance that could lead to the exacerbation of existing problems related to overpopulation such as food shortages, water scarcity, and urban overcrowding. Denying the existence of overpopulation and its associated problems risks allowing them to worsen.
