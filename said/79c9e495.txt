An environmental disaster is unfolding in India as toxic foam continues to spread across the city of Bengaluru.

The foam, which is believed to be toxic, began to appear in the city’s lakes earlier this month. It is believed to be caused by the discharge of untreated sewage and industrial effluents into the water body.

The foam has spread to cover large portions of the city’s iconic Ulsoor Lake and the nearby Sankey Tank. It has been reported to reach up to five feet in some areas.

The foam is so thick that it is hard to walk on the lake’s surface without slipping. The toxic foam has also been seen in other lakes around the city.

The Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) has ordered the closure of industries located near the lake and has taken water samples for testing. The board has also warned that any industries found to be responsible for the discharge of pollutants into the lake will face legal action.

The government is now trying to find a solution to the problem. The KSPCB has been asked to take immediate steps to clean up the lake and to prevent further pollution.

The incident is another example of how India’s water bodies are being polluted due to human activities. It is also a reminder of the need for better environmental protection and management of the country’s resources.
