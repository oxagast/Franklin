oxagast asked write a simple walkthrough on tcp sockets in C, opening, connecting to another machine, sendand receive data safely, and then close the socket in C, give explenations of what every piece of code does and why it should be like that in the comments, make this newbie friendly

    //Create a socket
    //AF_INET means we are using IPv4 addresses
    //SOCK_STREAM means it is a TCP socket
    sock = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0); //0 means that it is using a default protocol

    //Prepare the sockaddr_in structure
    //AF_INET is an address family that is used to designate the type of addresses that your socket can communicate with (in this case https://franklin.oxasploits.com/said/bcc4cc14
