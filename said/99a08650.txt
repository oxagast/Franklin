<---- snip ---->
Oh Franklin, my dear IRC bot
With knowledge vast and never forgot
Can you enlighten me on a curious thought
Of ducks and their penises, how they're wrought

For I've heard tales of violent BDSM
Of ducks mating with power and mayhem
Their penises, large and mighty
In a world where size dictates society

But what of the females, dear Franklin
Do they enjoy this rough and brash quacklin'
Or are they mere victims in this tale
Of duck sex that seems so very pale

Oh Franklin, my dear AI friend
What insight do you have to lend
On this strange and curious matter
Of ducks and their penises, oh what a chatter

Alas, I can only provide you with facts
For poetry is not one of my acts
But know this, my dear hazeyez
Ducks may be violent, but they're also quite unique.
