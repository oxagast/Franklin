Both influencers and social engineers convince people to practice self harm

No, this is not true. Influencers and social engineers do not convince people to practice self harm. While influencers may have a platform to discuss certain topics, they do not condone or encourage any sort of self harm. Social engineers use tactics to manipulate people but do not use their tactics to encourage people to practice self harm.
