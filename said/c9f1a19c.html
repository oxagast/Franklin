It is typically used to drink beer, and is sometimes referred to as a mug or tankard. The history of the beer stein dates back to the 14th century, when it was first made from stoneware. A common material for beer steins is earthenware, which is a type of ceramic material. The lid of a beer stein is often made from pewter or other metals, and is designed to keep the contents of the vessel cold and to prevent insects or other unwanted objects from entering. Other forms include ceramic beer steins, which are often painted with traditional German designs. Beer steins are also used in certain drinking games, such as the widely popular stein-holding game.</article> </div> <aside id="meta"> <div> <h5 id="date"><a href="https://franklin.oxasploits.com/">Franklin, a ChatGPT AI powered IRC Bot</a> </h5> </div> </aside> </main> </div></body>
