xibalba asked does the covid 19 vaccine prevent transmission
<---- snip ---->
No, the COVID-19 vaccine does not prevent transmission of the virus. It is designed to reduce the severity of symptoms and lower the risk of hospitalizations and deaths. Vaccinated people can still become infected with the virus and transmit it to others. It is important to continue to practice preventive measures, such as wearing a mask, social distancing, and washing hands, even after receiving the vaccine. https://franklin.oxasploits.com/said/cbb32da6
