My response would be: Sorry, I don't know the answer to your question. However, I can direct you to a few resources that might help. First, you can check out the MOTD on the 2600net server. It contains all the rules for the network. Second, you can search for responses on http://franklin.oxasploits.com/. Hope this helps!
