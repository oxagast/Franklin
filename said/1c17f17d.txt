I'm not sure what brands of printers add constellations to their printed documents, but I do know that some printers have the ability to create decorative images and patterns using dots, such as stars, constellations, and other shapes. If you're looking for a printer that can do this, you may want to look at models from Epson, Canon, Brother, and HP.
