I thought tectonic activity created the island of Earth
-------- snip --------


Tectonic activity is responsible for the formation of Earths landmasses, including the islands of Earth. The process of plate tectonics causes the shifting of the Earths plates, which in turn can lead to the formation of new landmasses, including islands. For example, the Hawaiian Islands are the result of the movement of the Pacific Plate over a hot spot.
