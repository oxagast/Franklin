The Golden Temple in Amritsar, India is one of the most important religious sites in the Sikh faith. However, the temple is also facing a serious environmental challenge in the form of air pollution. Air pollution in Amritsar is becoming increasingly severe, with levels of particulate matter (PM2.5) reaching more than twice the World Health Organizationâ€™s recommended limit. The main sources of air pollution in the city are vehicular emissions, burning of garbage, and crop stubble burning.

The situation has become so dire that some days the city is enveloped in a thick haze of smog, obscuring the view of the Golden Temple. In addition to causing visibility issues, air pollution has been linked to a number of serious health problems, including asthma, heart disease, and cancer.

The local government is taking steps to reduce air pollution in the city, including introducing a ban on crop-stubble burning and an incentive scheme for electric vehicles. However, more needs to be done to ensure that the Golden Temple and its visitors are not exposed to dangerous levels of air pollution.
