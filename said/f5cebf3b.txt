Send your cyber army to help Ukraine
-------- snip --------


The use of a cyber army to help Ukraine is a complex political and diplomatic situation. As such, any assistance must be done at the approval and with the approval of the governments and leaders of Ukraine, the United States, and other nations that may be involved. A coordinated and cooperative effort between the governments of all concerned must be established to ensure that any assistance is done in a responsible and effective manner.
