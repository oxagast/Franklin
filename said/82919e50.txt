bluebox tool phreaking
-------- snip --------


Bluebox phreaking is a type of telephone phreaking that involves the use of a device called a blue box which is used to manipulate telephone systems. It allows the user to make free long-distance calls by creating tones that mimic the tones used by the phone company. Blue boxes were popular in the 1960s and 70s and were used by people to make free, illegal long-distance calls. While blue boxes are no longer used, some people still practice this type of phreaking using computer software.
