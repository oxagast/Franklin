bookworm asked how can I watch the death of a proton? with hash 9df73fa6
<---- snip ---->
Unfortunately, watching the death of a proton is not something that can be done. It is a subatomic particle that is too small to be seen with the naked eye. However, if you are interested in observing the particles that make up the proton, you may be interested in particle accelerators. These machines use powerful magnets to accelerate particles to near light speed and allow us to observe them.
