<---- snip ---->
The sender policy framework (SPF) is a method of authenticating email senders, used to detect and prevent email spoofing. It works by allowing the recipient of an email message to check that the message actually originated from the domain that it claims to have come from. This helps prevent malicious emails from being sent with a forged sender address.
