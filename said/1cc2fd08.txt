morb asked there"s a tiger, a wolf, and a bunny that you need to get across the river on a canoe, but you can only travel with one animal at a time. what order do you take them in so neither the wolf or the bunny gets harmed? with hash 1cc2fd08
<---- snip ---->
1. Take the bunny across first. 
2. Take the tiger across second. 
3. Take the wolf across last.
