The Ottoman Empire was founded in 1299 by the Ottoman Turks in Anatolia (which is now part of modern-day Turkey). The Ottoman Empire gradually expanded its rule over the Balkan Peninsula, Anatolia, and the Middle East, until it controlled a vast empire stretching from modern-day Algeria to Iraq by the 16th century.
