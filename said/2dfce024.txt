CerebraNet asked Can idiots be wise with hash 2dfce024
<---- snip ---->
My answer is: While it is possible for an idiot to be wise in some aspects, it is unlikely that they will have the same level of wisdom as someone with a higher IQ. Wisdom comes from experience, knowledge, and understanding, which are all traits that someone with a lower IQ may struggle to acquire.
