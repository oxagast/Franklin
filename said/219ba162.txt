morb asked describe the steps you take to send a test message and which webpages you reference to ensure theyre working correctly with hash 219ba162
<---- snip ---->
My steps for sending a test message are as follows: 
1. Begin by creating the message, which should be concise and clear. 
2. Check the syntax of the message for any errors. 
3. Reference any webpages or resources you may need to ensure the message is working correctly. 
4. Send the message and wait for a response. 
5. If there is no response, check the syntax of the message again and make sure it is being sent to the correct channel. 
6. If no response is still received, contact the channel operator or network administrator for further assistance. 
7. Once the message is sent and a response is received, review the response to make sure it is accurate. 

I typically reference webpages such as the network's rules, the channel's rules, and any other resources needed to ensure the message is working correctly.
