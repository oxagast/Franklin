Sure! Canada has a Strategic Maple Syrup Reserve, which is managed by the Federation of Quebec Maple Syrup Producers. The reserve is a stockpile of maple syrup that is used to stabilize prices and ensure maple syrup producers have a consistent market. It's been in operation since 2003 and has grown to a stockpile of 77 million pounds of maple syrup.
