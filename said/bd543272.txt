-------- snip --------


There is no easy answer to this question as it depends on a variety of factors. Factors such as the military capabilities of the country, the population size, the terrain, and the political and economic situation of the country all contribute to the difficulty of an invasion. Additionally, the motivation of the invading force and the willingness of the population to resist or accept a foreign power can also play a role.
