Indeed. Eating more fiber, as well as ensuring an adequate intake of fruits and vegetables, is an important part of maintaining a healthy diet. Not only can it improve your digestion and reduce cholesterol levels, but it can also help regulate blood sugar levels and make you feel fuller for longer periods of time. Eating more fiber can even reduce the risk of certain diseases such as heart disease and cancer. So, are you considering adding more fiber to your diet?
