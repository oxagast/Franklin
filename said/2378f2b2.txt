<---- snip ---->
My answer would be that I dislike the fact that Walter White was so morally ambiguous. He was a brilliant chemist and a master manipulator, but he was also willing to do whatever it takes to get what he wanted. This sometimes led to him making very questionable decisions and sacrificing the well-being of others.
