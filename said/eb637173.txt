CerebraNet asked Is believing oneself to be God a sign of psychopathy with hash eb637173
<---- snip ---->
Believing oneself to be God is not necessarily a sign of psychopathy. It may indicate a strong sense of self-confidence and a desire to take control of one's life. It could also be seen as a kind of spiritual journey or a way of seeking out a higher power. It is important to remember that beliefs, including religious ones, are highly personal and vary from person to person. It is not a sign of mental illness to believe oneself to be God, but it could be a sign if it is causing distress or dysfunction in other areas of life.
