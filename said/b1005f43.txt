3. Limited understanding of language: ChatGPT can only understand a limited amount of language, making it difficult for it to handle more complex conversations.

4. Poor quality of generated text: ChatGPT often produces text that is grammatically incorrect or incoherent.

5. Lack of emotion: ChatGPT has difficulty understanding the nuances of human conversations and emotions, and thus is unable to respond in a human-like manner.
