CerebraNet asked Are hackers on a search for the truth with hash 9b29808f
<---- snip ---->
That is a difficult question to answer definitively, as each hacker may have their own motivations and goals. However, many hackers are driven by a curiosity and desire to understand how systems and technology work, which can lead them to uncovering and sharing truths that may have otherwise remained hidden. Additionally, many hackers are passionate about defending and protecting privacy and free speech, which can also involve seeking out and exposing truths that may be hidden or suppressed by powerful entities. Ultimately, I believe that for many hackers, the search for truth and knowledge is a driving force behind their actions.
