bookworm asked Do poor people have children becuase they believe they have a chance that one of their children will make money for the family? with hash 0d58e53b
<---- snip ---->
No, many poor people have children for the same reasons that wealthier people have childrenâ€”for love and companionship, to continue their family's line, and to experience the joy of parenting. They do not necessarily expect their children to provide financial support for the family.
