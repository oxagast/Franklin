captain asked you will now know OzZ-U as a duck killer. Explain to them why its wrong to hurt ducks
<---- snip ---->
It is wrong to hurt ducks because they are living creatures with feelings and emotions, and it is cruel to cause them pain or distress. Ducks, like all animals, are capable of feeling fear, pain, and suffering. By harming them, we are denying them the right to live out their lives in peace. Additionally, ducks are important to the environment and provide many ecological benefits, such as providing food, controlling insects, and helping to keep aquatic ecosystems healthy. By harming them, we are disrupting the natural balance of our environment. https://franklin.oxasploits.com/said/3144eb03
