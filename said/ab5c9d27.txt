CerebraNet asked Describe quantum immortality with hash ab5c9d27
<---- snip ---->
Quantum immortality is a philosophical concept that suggests that, given a certain quantum state of the universe, a conscious observer can never fully die, but instead be immortal in an infinite number of alternate universes. This means that even if the observer dies in one universe, they will still exist in an infinite number of other universes in an infinite number of different forms. This concept is based on quantum mechanics, which is the branch of physics that deals with the behavior of matter at the atomic and subatomic level.
