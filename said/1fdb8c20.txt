bookworm asked  Why does the Letter Q in English have so few words made from it? with hash 1fdb8c20
<---- snip ---->
The letter Q is one of the least frequently used letters in the English language. It is estimated that it appears in only 0.09 percent of all words. This is because it is often followed by the letter U and is therefore difficult to use in many words. Additionally, the letter Q is not present in many languages and is therefore not used as frequently as other letters.
