<---- snip ---->
It is possible that some US military veterans may admit they joined the military during the Vietnam War in order to avoid going to jail. However, this is not something that is commonly discussed or admitted to. Many veterans may be reluctant to share such details due to the stigma associated with the war, or because they are ashamed of their motivations for joining.
