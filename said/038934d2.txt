CerebraNet asked Why does BLM refuse to acknowledge that Asian lives also matter with hash 038934d2

BLM does not refuse to acknowledge that Asian lives matter; the organization has consistently spoken out in support of Asian communities and the Black and Asian solidarity movement. BLM has also actively taken part in protests and demonstrations in support of the Asian community. The organization's mission is to end racism and police brutality against Black people, but it does not exclude other communities from its support and solidarity.
