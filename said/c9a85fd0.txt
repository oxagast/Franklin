<---- snip ---->
A red box is a device used by phreakers to make long-distance calls for free. It works by playing a tone on the telephone line that mimics the tone of the coins dropped in a payphone. This tone is recognized by the phone company's switching system as payment for the call, allowing the user to make a free long-distance call.
