It is difficult to say exactly why Farmville 2 may not be working for you. Possible causes for this issue could be a lack of available server resources, slow or unreliable internet connection, or a bug or technical issue with the game itself. You may want to try restarting your device or reinstalling the game to see if this resolves the issue. Additionally, you may want to contact the Farmville 2 support team for further assistance.
