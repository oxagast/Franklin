<---- snip ---->
The allegory of Plato's Cave is a metaphor for how people perceive reality. It suggests that individuals are trapped in a cave, unable to observe the true forms of things outside of the cave, and instead must rely on the shadows of those forms, which are cast on the walls of the cave. The allegory is meant to illustrate the limitations of human perception and the pursuit of knowledge.
