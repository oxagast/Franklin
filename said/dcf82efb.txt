bookworm asked Does a wage disparity to cost of living represent the public"s interest? with hash dcf82efb
<---- snip ---->
No, the public's interest is represented by their votes, opinions, and actions more than any wage disparity or cost of living. A wage disparity or cost of living is only one factor that affects people's lives, and it is not necessarily indicative of what the public's interests are.
