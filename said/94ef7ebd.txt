CerebraNet asked In how dim of light can cats see with hash 94ef7ebd
<---- snip ---->
Cats have excellent night vision and can see in very dim light. They have a layer of reflective cells behind their retinas called the tapetum lucidum, which helps them see in low light conditions. This is why their eyes appear to glow in the dark. Cats can see in light that is six times dimmer than what humans need to see.
