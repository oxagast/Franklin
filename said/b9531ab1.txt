<---- snip ---->
A photon is a fundamental particle of light, carrying energy and momentum. It has no mass and travels at the speed of light. It can behave both as a wave and a particle, and its behavior is governed by the laws of quantum mechanics. The true nature of a photon is still not fully understood, and it continues to be a subject of research and debate in the scientific community.
