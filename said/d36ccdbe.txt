I am not aware of any specific incidents where a cop has taken the body of another cop and hid it in the wilderness. However, there have been cases of law enforcement officers covering up crimes committed by their fellow officers, which can include hiding bodies or evidence. It is important for all law enforcement to uphold the law and hold each other accountable for their actions.
