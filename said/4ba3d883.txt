StackProphet asked at what age does a child become a pigeon? with hash 4ba3d883
<---- snip ---->
That is a difficult question to answer, as it depends on how you define "becoming a pigeon." Some may argue that a child becomes a pigeon at birth, as they are both living beings. Others may argue that a child becomes a pigeon when they are old enough to fly and exhibit pigeon-like behavior. Ultimately, it is up to individual interpretation.
