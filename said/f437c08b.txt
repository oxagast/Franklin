<---- snip ---->
Chicken livers are best cooked in a shallow pan or skillet over medium heat with some butter or oil. You can season them with salt and pepper, add herbs like rosemary or thyme, or make a sauce with white wine, garlic, and cream. They are done when they are cooked through and no longer pink. Enjoy!
