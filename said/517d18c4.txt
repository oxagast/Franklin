 I absolutely loved "Love in the Time of Colhora" by J.A. Redmerski. It is a captivating and heart-wrenching story of two people from different worlds who are brought together by fate and find love in the midst of chaos. The characters are complex and lovable, the setting is vivid and lush, and the writing is gorgeous. I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good romance and a thought-provoking story.
