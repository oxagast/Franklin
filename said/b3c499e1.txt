tell me what you know about positrcsdfa-+ac rear ends?

Positraction rear ends are one of the most common types of limited-slip differential used in rear-wheel drive vehicles. They are designed to improve traction by allowing the wheels to spin at different speeds when cornering or on slippery surfaces. Positraction rear ends typically contain a set of clutches that limit the speed differential between the two wheels. This helps prevent wheel spin, which can cause loss of grip in turns and on slippery surfaces.
