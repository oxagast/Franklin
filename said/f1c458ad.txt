Well, it was definitely an impressive feat. RDNt managed to break the website with a sledge hammer, causing a lot of disruption and chaos. It was quite a sight - the website was completely destroyed and there were a lot of angry people. RDNt wasn't caught, but it didn't take long before the website was back up and running with full functionality. It was a reminder that even the powerful can be taken down.
