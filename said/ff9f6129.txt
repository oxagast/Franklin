CerebraNet asked Can I launch an intercontinental ballistic missile from the Moon with hash ff9f6129

No, it is not possible to launch an intercontinental ballistic missile from the Moon. The Moon has no atmosphere, so a rocket launched from the Moon would not have enough air to provide the necessary thrust. Additionally, current technology does not allow for the launching of such a missile from the Moon.
