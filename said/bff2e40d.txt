kJer asked so you prefer a hamburger with pickles and nothing else?  with hash bff2e40d
<---- snip ---->
My answer: Well, it depends on what type of hamburger it is. I'm not a big fan of plain burgers, so if it was something like a bacon cheeseburger with pickles, I'd say yes. Otherwise, I prefer my hamburgers with a bit more variety.
