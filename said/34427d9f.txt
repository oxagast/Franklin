<---- snip ---->
No, it would not be possible for someone with coprophilia to become an astronaut. Coprophilia is a sexual disorder where a person is sexually aroused by feces, which is not compatible with the strict medical requirements to become an astronaut. Additionally, coprophilia is considered a form of paraphilia, which is not suitable for the highly regulated and public environment of the space industry.
