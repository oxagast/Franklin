Raising and controlling a barrow wight is a complex and potentially dangerous process. The following steps should be followed to attempt to raise and control a barrow wight.

1. Locate a Potential Barrow Wight: You will need to first locate a potential barrow wight. This can be done by researching potential burial sites and using divination methods such as dowsing or scrying.

2. Prepare the Site: Once a potential barrow wight has been located, the site should be prepared. This includes clearing away any debris or vegetation that may be present and creating a physical barrier to ensure the wight does not escape.

3. Summon the Barrow Wight: To summon a barrow wight, you will need to perform a ritual to create a portal between the living and the dead. This can be done using a combination of incense, herbs, and candles.

4. Bind the Wight: Once the barrow wight is summoned, it must be bound in order to control it. This can be done by reciting a binding spell or using a physical object such as a chain or rope.

5. Control the Wight: Once the wight is bound, you must be able to control it. This can be done by using mental commands or by reciting a specific spell.

6. Release the Wight: When you are done with the barrow wight, you must release it back to the underworld. This can be done by reciting a releasing spell or by using a physical object such as a bell or an offering of food.

These steps should be followed if you are attempting to raise and control a barrow wight. However, it is important to remember that this is a dangerous process and should only be undertaken by skilled practitioners.
