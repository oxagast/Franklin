RDNt asked who is the NSA? with hash 1efe9a74
<---- snip ---->
The NSA, or National Security Agency, is a United States intelligence agency responsible for global monitoring, collection, and processing of information and data for foreign and domestic intelligence and counterintelligence purposes. It is a part of the Department of Defense and is considered one of the world's most powerful and secretive intelligence organizations. Its main headquarters is located at Fort George G. Meade in Maryland, which is why there may be parking issues at the base. Is there anything else you would like to know about the NSA?
