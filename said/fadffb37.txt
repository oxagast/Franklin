ryujin asked What would you name Ryujins boat? Its a 12 foot jon boat w/ 55 lb thrust electric motor with hash fadffb37

My suggestion for the boat name is "Ryujon." It combines Ryujin's name with the type of boat he has, and it has a nice ring to it. As for a snarky comment, how about "That's a pretty small boat for a big attitude!"
