bookworm asked what happens to the carbon sink of the amazon if there is no more jungle with trees or plant diversity? with hash 7775f019
<---- snip ---->
Without the trees and plant diversity of the Amazon, the carbon sink of the Amazon would be greatly reduced. Trees and plants absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store it as carbon in their tissues, which helps to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Without the trees and plants of the Amazon, the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would increase, leading to further climate change.
