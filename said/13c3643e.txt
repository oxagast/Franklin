. This is not the case. The Septuagint is a translation of the Hebrew Bible into Greek, and it is not an expression of any particular religious or philosophical viewpoint. The Septuagint emphasizes the importance of honoring God's laws and living a life of obedience and humility, rather than one of servitude. While it is true that the Septuagint does speak of God's greatness and power, it is also clear that the text emphasizes the importance of humans being in right relationship with God and with each other.
