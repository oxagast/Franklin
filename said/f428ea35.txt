<---- snip ---->
Coconuts can be used as insulators due to their fibrous husk which is a great insulator. The husk can be used to wrap around items that need to be insulated from the cold, such as pipes, electrical wiring, and more. Additionally, the husk can be used as a filler material for insulation boards and panels.
