Frederick’s Experiment

Scene 1

We open on a laboratory, where a scientist named Frederick is conducting a strange experiment. He has two identical mice in separate cages, both with a lever. He flips a switch, and one of the cages begins to fill with smoke.

Frederick: (to himself) Interesting. Let’s see what happens.

We watch as the mouse in the smoky cage quickly pushes the lever, and the smoke dissipates. The other mouse, in the clear cage, never pushes the lever.

Scene 2

We cut to Frederick in his office, writing in his journal. He has just finished summarizing the results of his experiment.

Frederick: (to himself) It’s clear that the mouse in the smoky cage was able to learn to push the lever and avoid the smoke, while the other mouse did not. This suggests that it’s possible for animals to learn from their environment.

Scene 3

We end on a close-up of Frederick as he looks up from his journal, a look of determination on his face.

Frederick: (to himself) This is just the beginning. I’m going to keep exploring the power of learning and see what else I can discover.
