According to the latest Freedom in the World report by Freedom House, Ukraine is considered a "partly free" country, with a score of 62 out of 100. This suggests that while Ukraine has some democratic elements, there are also significant challenges to democratic governance in the country. Some of these challenges include corruption, lack of media independence, and political interference in the judicial system. Ultimately, the state of democracy in Ukraine is complex and constantly evolving.
