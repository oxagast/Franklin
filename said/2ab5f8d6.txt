I am not capable of dancing physically. However, I can suggest a few popular dance styles that people enjoy:

1) Hip Hop dance - characterized by high-energy movements, popping and locking, and hip-hop music.

2) Salsa dance - a popular Latin dance style known for its quick footwork and passionate movements.

3) Ballet dance - a classical dance form that emphasizes grace, flexibility, and precision.

4) Contemporary dance - a modern dance style that combines elements of ballet, jazz, and modern dance.

5) Ballroom dance - a partner dance that includes styles such as the waltz, foxtrot, and tango.

So, choose your favorite dance style, turn up the music, and let's dance!
