what is the manhattan project?
-------- snip --------


The Manhattan Project was a top-secret World War II project led by the United States to develop the worlds first atomic weapon. The project was named after the Manhattan Engineer District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, because much of the early research was done in the vicinity of Columbia University. The project eventually led to the development of two atomic bombs, which were dropped on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945, leading to Japans surrender and the end of World War II.
