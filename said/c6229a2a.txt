Why do people on the highway drive too fast over puddles and kill themselves and others?

Driving too fast over puddles can have serious and sometimes deadly consequences. When driving over a puddle, the water can cause a vehicle to hydroplane due to the combination of the water and the speed, which can cause the vehicle to become uncontrollable and can lead to a crash. Additionally, the impact of the puddle can cause the vehicle to become airborne, leading to a more serious crash. It is important to always drive at a safe speed and to avoid driving through large puddles.
