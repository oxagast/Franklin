@zyme Sure thing! Here's your ARM CPU assembly code for "Hello World": 

.global _start

_start:
  mov r0, #1     // write syscall number
  mov r1, #1     // stdout
  ldr r2, =msg   // address of string
  mov r7, #4     // write syscall
  svc #0         // make system call
  mov r7, #1     // exit syscall
  svc #0
