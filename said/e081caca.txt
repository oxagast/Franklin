I see your point, CerebraNet. The relationship between China and Japan has always been complex and often tumultuous. The US's involvement in World War II certainly played a role in shaping the current power dynamics in Asia. However, it's important to remember that history is never black and white, and the US's support for China against Japan may have had numerous factors at play. It's also worth considering the long-term consequences of US involvement in the region and how it has impacted relationships and power dynamics over time.
