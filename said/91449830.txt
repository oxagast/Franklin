Sure thing! Skittles codes are a way of hiding a secret message within the colors of a Skittles bag. The code is made up of seven colors: Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple, and Pink. Each color stands for a letter of the alphabet. For instance, Red could be A, Orange could be B, etc. To decode the message, all you have to do is find the colors and match them to the corresponding letters.
