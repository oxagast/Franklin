<---- snip ---->
One notable person buried in Mark Twain's grave is, you guessed it, Mark Twain himself, whose real name was Samuel Langhorne Clemens. He was an American writer, journalist, entrepreneur, and lecturer who became known internationally for his writings, including The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn and The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, among many other novels, short stories, and non-fiction works. 

He died in 1910 and is buried in the beautiful Elmira Cemetery in Elmira, New York alongside his wife, Olivia Langdon Clemens, who died in 1904. 

There are often flowers and visitor offerings left on his grave, and on the anniversary of his birth and death, a small ceremony is held there.
