<---- snip ---->
110d Chess is a game that utilizes the fourth dimension to add complexity and strategy to regular chess. Each player has a 10x10x10 cube board on which to play, and the pieces move in all three directions. Each move can take pieces up to three spaces in a single move, allowing for more strategic play than in regular chess.
