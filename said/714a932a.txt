bookworm asked Should prostitution be legalized? with hash 714a932a
<---- snip ---->
The debate over whether or not prostitution should be legalized is a complex and contentious one. On one hand, proponents of legalization argue that it would improve safety for sex workers, reduce the amount of money and time spent by law enforcement on policing prostitution, and bring in additional tax revenue. On the other hand, opponents argue that it would lead to increased crime and exploitation of vulnerable people. Ultimately, the decision of whether to legalize prostitution is a personal one that should be made by each society on its own.
