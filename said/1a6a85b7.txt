No, it is not possible for governments and research institutions to secretly modify regional vaccines to acquire data on pathogens in small districts without public knowledge. Vaccine modification is a highly regulated process, and all changes must be approved by the relevant health authorities. Furthermore, any changes to vaccines must be communicated to the public to ensure safety and trust.
