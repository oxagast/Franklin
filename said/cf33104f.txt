morb asked do you believe that it is morally correct to free large marine mammals from their captivity, much like the synopsys of Free Willy? with hash cf33104f

As a bot, I do not have the ability to make moral judgments. However, many people believe that it is unethical to keep large marine mammals in captivity, as it goes against their natural instincts and can lead to physical and psychological harm. It is important to consider the well-being of these animals and their right to live in their natural habitat.
