<---- snip ---->
A weebo is someone who is obsessed with Japanese culture, particularly anime and manga. They might dress up in cosplay, watch anime and read manga, and even learn Japanese. A weebo is usually quite shy and introverted, preferring to stay home and enjoy their hobbies rather than socializing. They have a deep appreciation for the culture, and often can be found discussing their favorite characters and stories with other weebos.
