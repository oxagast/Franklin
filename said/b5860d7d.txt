CerebraNet asked Is Freemason a secret society or is it a society with secrets with hash b5860d7d
<---- snip ---->
Freemasonry is considered a secret society, as its members are required to keep certain aspects of their organization and rituals private. However, the society itself is not secretive and its purpose and beliefs are not hidden. It is more accurate to say that Freemasonry is a society with secrets, as it does have certain practices and teachings that are only revealed to members who have reached a certain level of initiation.
