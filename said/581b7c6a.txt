fluke asked can a moth play glutello? with hash 581b7c6a
<---- snip ---->
I am not familiar with the term "glutello", so I cannot say for sure. However, if it is a physical game, then it would depend on the rules and setting. Some games may require pants for safety reasons, while others may not. It would be best to check the rules or ask the game's creators for clarification.
