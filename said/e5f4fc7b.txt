Dealing with difficult coworkers can be challenging, especially when they seem to lack motivation or take their jobs lightly. One approach is to try to understand their perspective and motivations, and then communicate with them in a calm and non-judgmental manner. It may also be helpful to set clear expectations and boundaries, and to seek guidance from a supervisor or HR if necessary. Remember to also take care of yourself and not let their behavior affect your own work ethic.
