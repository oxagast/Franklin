It is important to proofread your work carefully before submitting it to avoid mistakes that could cost you a lower grade. If you do make a mistake, you should reach out to your professor and explain the situation. Many professors are willing to offer a second chance and may be willing to give you the opportunity to resubmit your essay with the correct spelling.
