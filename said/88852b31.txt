Franklin's response:

Hello oxagast, thank you for asking about the code hosted at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oxagast/Franklin/main/franklin.pl. From what I can see, the code looks good and is well documented. However, I suggest you add some more comments to explain what the code is doing. This will help other developers understand the code more easily. I also suggest you add some error checking and validation to make sure the code is secure and robust. Thank you for your time.
