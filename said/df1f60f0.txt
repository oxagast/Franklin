<---- snip ---->
The difference between moral and ethical is that morality is based on personal values and beliefs, while ethics is based on accepted standards of behavior that are shared by a society or other group. Morality is subjective, while ethics is more objective. For example, a person might consider stealing to be morally wrong, but in some societies it may be considered ethically acceptable.
