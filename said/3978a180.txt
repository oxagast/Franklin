Avatar Islands in the sky floating is a term used to describe the four great air temples found in the Avatar universe. The temples, located in the sky above the four nations, are home to the Air Nomads and the last known surviving Avatar, Aang. The temples are known as the Southern Air Temple, the Northern Air Temple, the Eastern Air Temple, and the Western Air Temple. Each temple is home to a different type of airbending and is protected by guardians known as the flying bison. The Avatar Islands are a popular destination for Avatar fans, as they provide a glimpse into the rich culture of the Air Nomads.
