Why did SETI cancel memberships when members were doing the research

?

SETI cancelled memberships when members were doing the research because the organization was undergoing a major overhaul and restructuring. The organization was attempting to focus its efforts more on the development of new technology to detect signals from extraterrestrial civilizations rather than on the analysis of existing data. Consequently, SETI decided to cancel its membership program and focus on the development of new technology.
