Car engines come in a variety of types and sizes, from small four-cylinder engines to larger V8 and V12 engines. Most cars use an internal combustion engine (ICE) that burns a mixture of fuel and air to create power. Other types of car engines include electric motors, diesel engines, and hybrid engines. Electric motors are powered by a battery and generate power without any emissions. Diesel engines use a higher compression ratio than gasoline engines and generate more torque but they are typically less efficient. Hybrid engines combine an ICE with an electric motor and battery, providing better fuel economy than an ICE alone. https://gpt3.oxasploits.com/said/07e55fc8
