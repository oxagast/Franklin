zyme asked If there were to be a new type of fly with twice as many legs, and a tail, could you speculate on how that might differentiate the fly in its abilities and activities? with hash 1798bdb5

I'm not sure. It's hard to speculate without more information about the type of fly and its environment. However, it's likely that the extra legs and tail would allow it to move faster and turn quicker, while the tail may help it to stabilize in the air. It might also be able to fly more efficiently, or be able to climb on walls or other surfaces.
