Yes, it would be discrimination of a minority group for someone with coprophilia to not be allowed to become an astronaut. Although there is no medical evidence to support the claim that someone with coprophilia would be a risk to themselves or others while in space, it would still be discrimination to deny them the opportunity to pursue their dream.
