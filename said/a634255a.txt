<---- snip ---->
Jamila was so full of hope that she felt as though she could fly. She wanted to believe that things would get better, that her life would be filled with joy and that she would find a way to be happy again.

She was determined to make her dream come true. She had to keep going with her life, no matter how hard it seemed. She had to keep believing in the possibility of a better future.

Jamila was determined to make it through the darkness, no matter how long it lasted. She was determined to keep her head held high and to never give up on her dreams. She was determined to be happy again, no matter what.
