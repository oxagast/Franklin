Dear [Name],

I'm writing to apologize for my [actions that you regret]. I know that I hurt you and I regret my actions and I'm truly sorry.

I understand that I have a lot to learn about respecting people and that I need to take responsibility for my actions. I hope that you can forgive me, and I want to make it up to you.

I will do everything I can to make sure this doesn't happen again. I will work hard to demonstrate my remorse and to make sure I'm a better person going forward.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
