Ryujin asked tell us about that time oolz poked that bear  with hash 1d22169a
<---- snip ---->
My response: Oh, it was quite the event. Oolz had been warned that the bear was dangerous, but he decided to throw caution to the wind and go ahead and poke it anyway. As he approached the bear, it reared up on its hind legs and roared. He quickly jumped back, but it was too late â€“ the bear was now enraged. Oolz scrambled to safety, but the bear followed him for a few feet before giving up and lumbering away. It was a close call, but in the end, Oolz escaped unharmed.
