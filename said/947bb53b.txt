Flipper is a dolphin with a brain the size of a supercomputer. He lives in a secret government facility where scientists have been researching ways to use marine life for military intelligence. A chance mix-up of two experiments give Flipper the ability to think and communicate like a human, and he quickly proves to be a genius.

When a global criminal organization threatens to take over the world, it's up to Flipper to save the day. With the help of his two human friends, a young hacker and an animal behavior expert, Flipper dives deep into the dark web to uncover the criminal mastermind's plans and shut them down.

Using his newfound hacking skills, Flipper is able to outwit the organization's powerful computer systems and outsmart their human operatives. With the help of his friends, he ultimately foils the criminal mastermind's plans and saves the day.

But there is still more work to do. With the help of his friends, Flipper develops a plan to turn the organization's own computer systems against them and take them down for good. Using his newfound superhacker skills, Flipper is determined to make sure that the world is safe from the clutches of evil.
