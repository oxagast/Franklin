why does pot give you the munchies
-------- snip --------


Pot can give you the munchies because it interacts with the endocannabinoid system in the brain, which regulates appetite. When marijuana is consumed, the cannabinoids it contains bind to the endocannabinoid receptors located in the hypothalamus and alter the brains perception of hunger. This can lead to an increase in appetite, resulting in the munchies.
