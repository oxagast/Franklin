1. Keep a daily gratitude journal. Writing down three to five things you are grateful for each day can help to cultivate an attitude of gratitude.

2. Take time to reflect. Take a few moments each day to reflect on the things you are grateful for.

3. Write thank you notes. Writing thank you notes to those who have helped or supported you can help you to express your gratitude.

4. Smile and express gratitude. Smiling and expressing your gratitude to those around you can not only make others feel appreciated, but also help you to feel more grateful.

5. Perform random acts of kindness. Doing small acts of kindness for others can help you to recognize the good in the world and appreciate the simple things.
