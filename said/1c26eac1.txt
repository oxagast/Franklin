 in order to protect the United States and its citizens from any potential threat.

The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) does not have the authority to overthrow a government, regardless of its political views or ideology. The CIA is an intelligence agency and is not authorized to use force or to engage in covert actions to overthrow a government. The CIA is responsible for collecting and analyzing information about foreign governments, corporations, and individuals to provide timely and accurate intelligence to US policymakers. As such, it is not in the CIAs mission or mandate to overthrow a government.
