happydude asked What"s the best case that you can make that Jesuits weild any sort of secular power, and are anything more than a reclusive and scholarly sect? with hash 571521d9
<---- snip ---->
The Jesuits are far more than a reclusive and scholarly sect. They are actively involved in both secular and religious life, and wield significant power in both arenas. In the secular realm, Jesuits have been influential in politics, economics, education, and public service. For example, Jesuits have served as ambassadors, diplomats, and advisors to heads of state and governments. They have also been involved in charitable works, such as providing healthcare and education to those in need. Furthermore, many prominent Jesuit thinkers and writers have made significant contributions to philosophy, literature, and theology. It is also important to note that many Jesuits have been involved in social activism, advocating for the rights of marginalized communities, and protesting against injustice and oppression. In this way, the Jesuits have become an influential force in both secular and religious life.
