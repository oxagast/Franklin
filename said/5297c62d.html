<br><i>Mon May  1 19:48:50 2023</i><br><br><br><b>morb</b> asked: <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp if hitler didn\\'t panic because the cyanide pill\\'s dose was too low then why did he do himself in with a luger <br><br>Hitler likely committed suicide with a Luger pistol because it was a symbol of Germany's military might. He wanted to show his commitment to his cause and to demonstrate that he would rather die than surrender to the Allied forces. The cyanide pill may have been used as a backup in case he failed to take his own life with the Luger.
