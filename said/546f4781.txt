Klonopin is a benzodiazepine, which is a type of medication that works to reduce anxiety, relax muscles, and produce a calming effect. It can be used to treat a variety of conditions, including vertigo. It works by affecting the chemicals in the brain that are responsible for regulating balance and coordination, which can help relieve the dizziness and other symptoms associated with vertigo. It can also reduce the feeling of spinning or motion sickness associated with vertigo.
