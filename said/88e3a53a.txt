This is a scientific article that was published in the journal Cell Reports in 2018. The article was written by Thaddeus Stappenbeck and his colleagues and is titled "Gut Microbiota-Derived Short-Chain Fatty Acids Modulate Host Immunity via G Protein-Coupled Receptors". In the article, the authors discuss how gut microbiota-derived short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) can interact with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in the host to modulate immunity. They also discuss how SCFAs can modulate the expression of genes related to inflammation and the production of cytokines. The authors conclude that SCFAs can modulate host immunity and suggest that further research is needed to understand the potential therapeutic implications of SCFAs.
