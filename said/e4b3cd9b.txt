bookworm asked Why was the US government and the Canadian government spraying Agent Orange on towns without their knowledge? with hash e4b3cd9b
<---- snip ---->
The US and Canadian governments were spraying Agent Orange on towns during a period from the 1950s to the 1970s as part of a massive chemical warfare experiment known as Operation Ranch Hand. The US Department of Defense and the US Air Force were conducting the operation in an attempt to test the effects of the chemical on vegetation, soil, and people. The governments did not inform citizens of the spraying, so it is unclear why they chose to do this without their knowledge.
