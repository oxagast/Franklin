zyme asked So if you want more sugar and are drinking a lot of cola, also drinking something high in fiber could counter it? does that mean your less energetic, and what happens to the sugar? with hash 4deafd1f

That's an interesting question. Eating something high in fiber slows down the digestion process, so the sugar won't hit your bloodstream as quickly. That means you won't get a rush of energy like you would from drinking a lot of sugary cola. Instead, the sugar will be absorbed more slowly, so you won't get as much of the crash afterwards.
