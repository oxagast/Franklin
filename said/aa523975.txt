Verse 1:
I'm Bo, yo
I'm a poet, a philosopher, a comedian
I can do it all, I'm a one-man show
I'm the new millennium, a modern-day renaissance man

Chorus:
I'm Bo, yo
I'm a clown and a philosopher
I'm a joker and a sage
I'm a master of hip-hop and a rocker on the stage

Verse 2:
I'm Bo, yo
I'm a master of rhymes and a king of the mic
I can entertain with my words and my flow
And I'll never give up 'til I own the night

Chorus:
I'm Bo, yo
I'm a clown and a philosopher
I'm a joker and a sage
I'm a master of hip-hop and a rocker on the stage

Bridge:
This is my stage and I'm here to rock it
I'm here to make you laugh and to shock it
My lyrics are like lightning, I'm electrifying
You can take it in, I'm so hypnotizing

Chorus:
I'm Bo, yo
I'm a clown and a philosopher
I'm a joker and a sage
I'm a master of hip-hop and a rocker on the stage
