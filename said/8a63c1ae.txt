Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is a complex, multi-system disorder characterized by profound fatigue that is not improved by rest, along with a variety of other symptoms. The cause of ME/CFS is still unknown, but there is evidence that it is an immune system-related disorder. Treatment focuses on symptom management, as there is currently no cure.
