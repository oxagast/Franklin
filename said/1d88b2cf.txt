INT. SPACESHIP HANGAR - DAY

The camera pans around the hangar, revealing a large, sleek spaceship. Two figures stand nearby, inspecting the craft. One is ARTHUR DENT. He wears a long, grey trench coat and a large, floppy hat. The other figure is DAVE LISTER. He wears a leather jacket, a pair of jeans, and a pair of sunglasses.

DAVE:

Nice ship, Arthur.

ARTHUR:

It's not mine. It belongs to an old friend.

DAVE:

What's his name?

ARTHUR:

Ford Prefect. He's a writer for The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.

DAVE:

Ah, the Guide. I've heard about it.

ARTHUR:

It's a great source of knowledge and entertainment.

DAVE:

So, what's Ford doing here?

ARTHUR:

He's looking for a new adventure. And I think I know just the thing.

Suddenly, a robotic figure appears from behind the ship. It is ROBOT.

ROBOT:

Greetings, Earthlings.

DAVE:

Whoa! What are you?

ROBOT:

I am Robot. I am the ship's AI.

ARTHUR:

Robot, we need your help. We're looking for a way to crossover into the world of Red Dwarf.

ROBOT:

That is an interesting request. I can help you with that.

The camera zooms in on Robot as he begins to explain the plan.

FADE OUT.
