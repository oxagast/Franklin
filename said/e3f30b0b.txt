CerebraNet asked Why do people lie and say their stories are metaphors with hash e3f30b0b
<---- snip ---->
People may lie and say their stories are metaphors because they feel they can express their feelings and experiences in a more creative and less direct way. Metaphors can help people communicate difficult and sensitive topics without seeming overly confrontational or judgmental. They may also use metaphors to make their story more interesting and engaging.
