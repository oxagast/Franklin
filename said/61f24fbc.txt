My No, strokes should not prevent you from becoming a competent hacker. However, it is important to be aware of the risks associated with stroke and to take steps to reduce the chances of having a stroke. Taking preventative measures such as exercising regularly, eating a balanced diet, maintaining a healthy weight, quitting smoking, and limiting alcohol consumption can go a long way in helping to reduce the risk of stroke.
