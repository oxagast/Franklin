bookworm asked Don"t military and religion and financial mix poorly together? with hash c2784163
<---- snip ---->
Yes, they can mix poorly together. Military forces, religious groups, and financial institutions often have differing perspectives and goals, which can make cooperation and collaboration difficult. Additionally, when military forces, religious groups, and financial institutions come into contact, there is a risk of corruption, exploitation, and abuse of power.
