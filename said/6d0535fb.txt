My response would be: On June 4th 1989, the Chinese government violently cracked down on a pro-democracy protest in Beijing's Tiananmen Square, killing hundreds of peaceful demonstrators. The event became known as the Tiananmen Square Massacre and is remembered as a turning point in Chinese history.
