Summarize how Anxiety causes symptoms of vertigo.
-------- snip --------


Anxiety can cause symptoms of vertigo due to the bodyâ€™s response to stress. Anxiety causes the body to produce adrenaline and cortisol, which can cause the body to become overly tense and cause the inner ear to become unbalanced, which is what causes vertigo. Anxiety can also cause hyperventilation which can lead to dizziness and vertigo as well. Additionally, anxiety can cause an increase in blood pressure which can make vertigo symptoms worse.
