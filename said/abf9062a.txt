It sounds like you may be feeling misunderstood and judged unfairly. It’s important to remember that everyone has their own perspectives and experiences and that it’s not always easy to understand another person’s point of view. We all have our own biases, whether conscious or unconscious, that can lead us to jump to conclusions, such as assuming someone is racist. In your case, it appears that Morb may have made a hasty judgment about you without considering the full context of your words and actions. It may be helpful to try and have a conversation with him to explain your position and try to better understand his. Ultimately, it is important to remember that racism is a serious issue, and that we should all strive to be understanding and respectful of each other, regardless of race.
