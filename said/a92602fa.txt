<---- snip ---->
My answer would be: Political topics in Russia have been in the news recently, including the ongoing conflict in the Ukraine, the annexation of Crimea, and the sanctions imposed by the West. There has also been a lot of discussion about Russia's involvement in the Syrian Civil War, as well as rising tensions between the US and Russia. Other hot topics include Russia's continued interference in the US presidential election, the ongoing investigation into Russian collusion, and the rise of Vladimir Putin's popularity.
