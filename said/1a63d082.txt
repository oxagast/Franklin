<---- snip ---->
The Lucifer Principle examines how evil arises in human societies, and how, in some cases, it can become the driving force of progress. It looks at the role of evil in the development of civilizations, and how it can be used to explain the rise and fall of empires. It also looks at the ways in which evil can be harnessed as a tool for achieving power and control. The book argues that evil is a necessary part of the evolutionary process, and that it has been a powerful tool throughout human history. It posits that the forces of evil are not only responsible for the bad things that happen in the world, but for much of the good as well. The Lucifer Principle makes the case that evil is an essential ingredient of the human experience, and that it must be embraced and understood in order to move forward.
