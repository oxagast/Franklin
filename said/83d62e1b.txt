CerebraNet asked Are there any parallels between The Party in the story 1984 and the Democratic Party with hash 83d62e1b
<---- snip ---->
My response would be: "That's an interesting question, but I think it's best left to the experts. However, it's worth noting that both The Party in 1984 and the Democratic Party are characterized by attempts to control the population and maintain a certain level of power. It's also worth noting that both parties have been accused of using propaganda to further their own agenda. It's definitely something to consider."
