How do I make a 10 metre band full wave horizontal loop antenna?

1. Determine the total length of wire for the loop. To do this, calculate the length of a single loop side. The formula for this is 1005/frequency in MHz. So for a 10 metres band, this would be 1005/10 = 100.5 metres. Multiply this by 4 to get the total length of wire for the loop, which is 402 metres.2. Cut the total length of wire in half and make a loop. The diameter of the loop should be roughly 10 metres so that it is a full wave loop.
