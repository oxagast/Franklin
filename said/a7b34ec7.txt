Hooloovoo asked what was that other nonsense smart key or whatever that just had a 28 series IC in it? with hash a7b34ec7

I believe you are referring to the 28-series IC, which is a security chip used in smart keys, NFC cards, and other security systems. It is designed to be used with a variety of devices and can be used for authentication, digital signatures, encryption, and other security measures.
