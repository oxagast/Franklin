Rap can make people feel like victims for a variety of reasons, such as its lyrics and themes. Sometimes, people can identify with the lyrics of rap songs and feel like they're victims even if they're not. It can also be because of the way rap is often presented in the media, painting a picture of struggle and oppression that many people can relate to.</article> </div> <aside id="meta"> <div> <h5 id="date"><a href="https://franklin.oxasploits.com/">Franklin, a ChatGPT AI powered IRC Bot</a> </h5> </div> </aside> </main> </div></body>
