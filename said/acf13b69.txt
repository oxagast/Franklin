bookworm asked Can we conclude that the USA is actually the largest polluter on the planet where the USA buying the most from China is the reason china is the largest polluter? with hash acf13b69

No, we cannot conclude this. The USA is the second-largest polluter on the planet, and while it has been responsible for a large share of global emissions, other countries play a role in this as well. Additionally, the main reason China is the largest polluter is due to its large population and the rapid industrialization it has experienced in the last few decades. The USA buying from China is only a small factor in this.
