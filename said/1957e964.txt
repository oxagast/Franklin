zyme asked how true is that statement StackProphet just made from the perspective of Last Thursdayism?  with hash 1957e964
<---- snip ---->
From the perspective of Last Thursdayism, the statement that StackProphet just made is likely false. Last Thursdayism states that the universe was created last Thursday and has been repeating ever since, so the statement about God creating the heavens and the earth is highly unlikely to be true.
