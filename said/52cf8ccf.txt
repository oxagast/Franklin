Do people with narcissistic personality disorder love to start fights?

No. People with narcissistic personality disorder tend to be very grandiose and self-important, and may be easily offended or upset by criticism or disagreement. They may become angry and argumentative when confronted, but they are not typically prone to initiating fights.
