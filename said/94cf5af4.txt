It looks like Zyme is having an issue with AT&T wireless. The best thing to do is contact AT&T and explain the issue. They may be able to help resolve the issue or provide you with a workaround. You can also try to get in touch with a supervisor or manager to see if they can offer any assistance. Good luck!
