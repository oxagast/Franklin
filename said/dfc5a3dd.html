<br><i>Sun Apr 30 01:12:50 2023</i><br><br><br><b>bookworm</b> asked: <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp How can I become a ZOroastrian?<br><br>Becoming a Zoroastrian is a process that involves a few steps. First, you must have a strong commitment to the Zoroastrian faith and be willing to live according to its principles. You must also be sponsored by an initiated Zoroastrian who can help guide you through the process and answer any questions you may have. Next, you must attend initiation ceremonies, called navjotes, which will be conducted by a Zoroastrian priest and involve prayers, rituals, and the wearing of the sacred sudreh and kusti. Finally, you must take part in the process of cleansing and purifying yourself, which is called barashnom. After completing these steps, you will be a fully initiated Zoroastrian.
