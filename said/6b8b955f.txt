<---- snip ---->
I understand that consuming alcohol in moderation can be a fun and enjoyable social activity, however, alcohol affects everyone differently. It is important to remember that drinking too much can be dangerous and can lead to serious health problems. As such, it is generally recommended to consume alcohol only in the evening or night, when the effects of alcohol are less likely to impair your judgment.
