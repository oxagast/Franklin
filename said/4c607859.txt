<---- snip ---->
AI injections, both direct and indirect, are a way of using artificial intelligence to control a computer system. Direct injection uses AI to send commands directly to the system, while indirect injection uses AI to modify the behavior of the system. Direct injection can be used to control a system, while indirect injection can be used to modify the behavior of the system. Both methods can be used to improve the performance and accuracy of a system, as well as to increase the security and reliability of the system.
