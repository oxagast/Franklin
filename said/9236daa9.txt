1. Gather supplies: You will need an air filter, a fan, PVC piping, duct tape, a plastic sheet, cardboard, and plastic sheeting.

2. Assemble the air filter: Connect the PVC piping to the fan, and attach the air filter to the other end. Secure the connections with duct tape.

3. Build the walls: Cut the cardboard into strips and then attach the strips to the plastic sheeting. Secure the ends of the strips with duct tape.

4. Create the ceiling: Cut the plastic sheet into a rectangular shape and attach it to the walls. Secure the edges with duct tape.

5. Put it all together: Place the fan and air filter inside the box and then place the walls and ceiling around them. Secure the edges with duct tape.

6. Plug it in and turn it on: Connect the fan to an electrical outlet and turn it on. The air filter should now be filtering the air in the box.
