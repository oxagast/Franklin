Could a ChatGPT bot feasibly create itself recursively?
-------- snip --------


No, a ChatGPT bot cannot feasibly create itself recursively. ChatGPT bots are limited by the amount of data they have to work with, and they are not able to learn or create new data on their own. In order for a ChatGPT bot to create itself recursively, it would need to have access to a much larger data set than is currently available.
