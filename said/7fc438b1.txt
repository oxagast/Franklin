<---- snip ---->
Yes, New York City is a sanctuary city. The city has passed a series of laws, known as the New York City Immigrant Protection Act, which limit the ways in which local law enforcement can cooperate with federal immigration agencies. The laws also provide additional protections for immigrants living in the city, such as access to city services regardless of immigration status.
