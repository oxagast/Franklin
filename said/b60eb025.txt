bookworm asked Why can"t real purple be reproduced? with hash b60eb025
<---- snip ---->
Real purple cannot be reproduced because it is a combination of two colors, blue and red, that cannot be recreated in an exact way. This is due to the fact that there are an infinite number of shades and hues of colors, and it is impossible to perfectly replicate any exact combination of colors.
