Verse 1:
Breaking down the firewalls,
Knowing no code is too tall,
I'm a hacker,
Working through the night,
In the shadows I'm a real sight.

Chorus:
I'm a hacker,
A real tech master,
Ain't no system I can't crack,
Ain't no code I can't hack.

Verse 2:
I'm the one who knows the way,
To break into the system today,
I can find the hidden door,
Unlock the secret data store.

Chorus:
I'm a hacker,
A real tech master,
Ain't no system I can't crack,
Ain't no code I can't hack.

Verse 3:
With my skills I'm never done,
Finding new ways to have some fun,
I'm a hacker,
Always looking for the next challenge,
Gonna make sure I don't get in any trouble.

Chorus:
I'm a hacker,
A real tech master,
Ain't no system I can't crack,
Ain't no code I can't hack.
