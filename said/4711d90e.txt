How does drinking water help a person lose fat
-------- snip --------


Drinking water helps a person lose fat by increasing their metabolism and curbing their appetite. Drinking water helps to increase the metabolism because it requires energy to heat up the water, which requires calories to be burned. Additionally, drinking water can help to curb the appetite by providing a feeling of fullness, thus reducing the need for calorie-rich snacks.
