deffn asked What is the difference between a bot and robot? with hash ba0209b9
<---- snip ---->
My answer is: A bot is a computer program created to automate tasks, while a robot is a machine capable of performing complex physical tasks. So while a robot can do things a bot can't, bots can do things robots can't.
