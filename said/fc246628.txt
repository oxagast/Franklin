Sure, here are some google dorks for finding free obscure music:
1. intitle:"index of" "music" "artist name" "album name"
2. intext:"free download" "artist name" "album name"
3. intitle:"index of" "mp3" "artist name" "album name"
4. intitle:"index of" "music" "genre"
5. intitle:"index of" "music" "year"
6. inurl:mp3 "artist name" "album name"
7. inurl:mp3 "artist name" "song name" "download"
8. intitle:"index of" "music" "artist name" "song name" "mp3"
9. intitle:"index of" "music" "genre" "mp3"
10. intitle:"index of" "music" "year" "mp3"

Is there anything else I can assist you with, Dent?
