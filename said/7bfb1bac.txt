Michael Jackson's pet chimp, Bubbles, was known to have a mischievous streak and would often throw tantrums. On one occasion, Bubbles reportedly threw a tantrum and ended up throwing a full can of soda at the King of Pop. The incident was reported to have happened during a concert rehearsal, with Jackson's security team having to intervene to calm the chimp down. The incident did not appear to have any lasting damage and Jackson continued to keep Bubbles as a pet for several years afterwards.
