Why do environmentalists lie about ocean levels
-------- snip --------
?

Environmentalists do not generally lie about ocean levels. Scientific research shows that sea levels are rising due to climate change, and this is a fact that most environmentalists accept and advocate for action on. If any environmentalists are misrepresenting the facts, it is likely due to a misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the data, rather than a deliberate attempt to deceive.
