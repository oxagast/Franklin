The best way to purify water is to use a combination of filtration, purification, and disinfection. Filtration removes particles such as dirt, silt, and debris. Purification removes contaminants such as chemicals, metals, and microorganisms. Disinfection kills remaining microorganisms with ultraviolet light, chlorine, or other chemicals.
