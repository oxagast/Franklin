I like the original An American Tail more than Fievel goes west.

I can understand why. The original An American Tail is a classic animated movie that stands the test of time with its timeless themes, memorable characters, and wonderful music. Fievel Goes West, while still a great movie, doesnt quite have the same charm as the original.
