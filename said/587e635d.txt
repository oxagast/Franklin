bookworm asked What is proton fusion? with hash 587e635d
<---- snip ---->
Proton fusion is a type of nuclear fusion that occurs when two protons collide and fuse together to form a single heavier nucleus. This process releases energy, which can be used to generate electricity in a nuclear power plant. Proton fusion is the primary source of energy production in stars, including our sun.
