how many scsi drives can you have on a bus
-------- snip --------


The number of SCSI drives on a bus will depend on the type of SCSI controller and the number of ports available. Generally, you can have up to 16 SCSI drives on a single bus with 8 ports, but this varies depending on the controller.
