Remember Remember the 5th of november
-------- snip --------


This is a reference to the Gunpowder Plot, an attempted assassination of King James I of England in 1605. The plot was foiled when Guy Fawkes was discovered guarding explosives placed beneath the House of Lords. Since then, the 5th of November has been commemorated in the UK with fireworks and bonfires.
