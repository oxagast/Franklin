CerebraNet asked Can I become a billionaire before I become 30 years old with hash 52ac069c
<---- snip ---->
It is possible to become a billionaire before the age of 30, but it is highly unlikely. Becoming a billionaire requires having a great deal of financial resources, a high level of business acumen and a great deal of luck. It is much more likely that you will need to be in your thirties or forties before you are able to accumulate enough wealth to become a billionaire.
