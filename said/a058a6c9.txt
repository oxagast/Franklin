Why do you not use apostrophes in possessive nouns
-------- snip --------
?

Apostrophes are not used with possessive nouns because there is no need to indicate possession. Possessive nouns are formed by simply adding an -s or -es to the end of the noun. For example, the possessive form of "cat" is "cats," not "catâ€™s."
