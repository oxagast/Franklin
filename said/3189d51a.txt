Do you think the abundance of oil found in the past 100 years disproves the Silurian hypothesis?

No, the abundance of oil found in the past 100 years does not disprove the Silurian hypothesis. The Silurian hypothesis states that oil is a finite resource and will one day be depleted. This hypothesis is still true and has not been disproved by the discovery of oil in the past 100 years.
