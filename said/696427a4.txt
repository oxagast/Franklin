 confinement

Kevin Mitnick was put in solitary confinement by the judge due to the fact that Mitnick was considered a flight risk, had a history of computer-related crimes, and had violated the terms of his release. The judge felt that solitary confinement was the only way to ensure that Mitnick would remain in custody and not be able to access any computer systems while awaiting trial.
