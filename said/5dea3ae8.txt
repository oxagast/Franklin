No, you cannot fire a rocket twenty miles offshore into space. Rockets must be launched from a launch facility, such as a launch pad or spaceport, which are typically located on land. Additionally, rockets must reach high speeds in order to escape Earth's atmosphere and reach space, which would be difficult to achieve from a location so close to the ground.
