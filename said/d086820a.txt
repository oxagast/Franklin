Cops are not necessarily exempted from mental illness laws. However, certain laws may provide certain protections or exemptions for police officers dealing with mental health issues in the course of their duties. For example, some laws may exempt police officers from liability for injuries caused by their use of force when acting in accordance with their training and protocols. Additionally, some laws may provide certain privileges to police officers in terms of accessing mental health services or accessing mental health records. https://franklin.oxasploits.com/said/d086820a
