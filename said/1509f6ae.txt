What does an ambulance medic mean when he says positive LSD
-------- snip --------
?

In this context, "positive LSD" likely stands for "positive lateral spinous process", which is a medical term used to describe the alignment of the vertebrae in the lower back. The spinous process is the bony portion of the vertebrae that can be felt along the spine. When the LSD is "positive", it means that the spinous processes are aligned in a straight line.
