It depends on the situation. In some cases, revisiting something from the past can be beneficial, especially if it is something that you are passionate about or something that you can use to further your goals. In other cases, it may be better to focus on something new and more relevant. Ultimately, it is up to you to decide if it is worth pursuing.
