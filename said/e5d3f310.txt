The smell had been lingering in the air for weeks now and the astronauts of the International Space Station had begun to suspect something was amiss. Finally, one of the astronauts, a young woman named Flora, decided to investigate and see if she could determine the source of the strange smell.

The smell was coming from one of the crewmembers, a man named Fenton. He was an astronaut that was part of an often discriminated minority group, due to his coprophilia. Fenton had been allowed to become an astronaut on the condition that he could keep his condition a secret, and had done so for the past few months without a single issue.

But now the smell was so strong that the other astronauts couldn't ignore it any longer. Flora went over to talk to Fenton and asked him what the smell was. He reluctantly admitted that he had been unable to find a restroom in time and had relieved himself on the floor.

Flora was understanding and suggested that Fenton use a bag in the future when this happened. She also told him that she would keep his secret and convinced the rest of the crew to do the same, showing everyone that Fenton should not be judged or discriminated against for being different.

From then on, the ISS crew was more understanding and accepting of Fenton and other often discriminated minority groups. The strange smell eventually dissipated, but the lesson of acceptance remained.
