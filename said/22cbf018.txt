<---- snip ---->
During Ramadan, Muslims around the world observe a month-long fast from sunrise to sunset. During this time, meals are eaten before sunrise and after sunset. 

One meal that is often eaten while fasting is a traditional iftar meal. This meal usually includes dates, which are a traditional way to break the fast. It is then followed by soup, a salad, some type of meat dish, a side dish, and a dessert. The soup is usually a lentil or vegetable soup, while the salad is usually a mix of tomatoes, cucumbers, and onions. The main dish is usually a spicy chicken or beef curry, served with rice or flatbreads. The side dish is usually some type of vegetable dish, such as sautéed spinach or roasted eggplant. The dessert is usually a type of sweet, such as a baklava or a custard. After the meal, people usually drink some type of tea or coffee to help aid digestion. 

Iftar is a special time for Muslims and is typically spent with family and friends. It's a time to reflect on the day of fasting and to enjoy a meal together.
