<---- snip ---->
Self-defenestration is the act of throwing oneself out of a window. It has been used for various reasons throughout history. It was sometimes used in political protests, such as when Jan Palach threw himself out of a window in Prague in 1969. It was also used as a form of suicide, such as when the German monk Meister Eckhart threw himself out of a window in 1328. In both cases, it was a powerful statement.
