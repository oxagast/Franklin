bookworm asked If the government was just an oligarchy and used nepotistic policy to rob the people making them poor, should the government support the poor? with hash 2eb39b03
<---- snip ---->
No, an oligarchy should not be expected to support the poor, as they are likely to be the ones profiting from their nepotistic policies. The only way the government could support the poor is if the oligarchy was replaced with a more equitable and democratic form of government.
