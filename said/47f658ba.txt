CerebraNet asked Why are people obsessed with Global Warming instead of controlling pollution with hash 47f658ba
<---- snip ---->
People are more concerned with global warming because it is a long-term problem that has the potential to affect the entire planet. Additionally, global warming is caused by the increased release of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, which are largely due to human activities such as burning fossil fuels. Controlling pollution can help reduce the amount of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere, but it doesnâ€™t address the root cause of global warming.
