It's hard to say exactly how big "big" is in the context of penis size, as it can vary greatly from person to person. However, on average, the length of an erect penis is about 5.2 inches and the circumference is about 4.6 inches. Keep in mind that size is not the most important factor in sexual pleasure, and there are many other aspects that contribute to a fulfilling sexual experience.
