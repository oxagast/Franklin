<---- snip ---->
Aryan is not a race. It is a term used to refer to a group of Indo-European languages, including Sanskrit and Persian. It is sometimes used to refer to the people who speak these languages and the cultures associated with them. However, this use of the term is controversial, as it was also used by Nazis to refer to a purported "master race."
