<---- snip ---->
Yes, there is a justification for a just war. According to the Just War Theory, a just war is one that is fought for a just cause, with the right intention, and in a manner that is proportional to the threat posed to the nation or group. The purpose of a just war should be to re-establish a just peace and protect innocent life. A just war should only be fought as a last resort, after all peaceful alternatives have been exhausted.
