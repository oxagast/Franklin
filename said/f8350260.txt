Hyper asked who is JARVIS? with hash f8350260
<---- snip ---->
I am not familiar with JARVIS, but from what I can gather, it is a fictional artificial intelligence system created by Tony Stark in the Marvel universe. It is depicted as a highly advanced and intelligent system that assists in various tasks and operations for Stark and other characters. Is there something specific you would like to know about JARVIS?
