"I got out the old Durango ninety-five and plugged the Durango in at the mains and I loaded up the eight-millimeter Beethoven and I sat and I gept and I watched it, very classical it was too, oh very deep and masterly. All the music and all the pictures of the long-ago love and the strange-looking people with the funny-shaped hats and the horses, some with people on their backs and some with carts, and the woods and the streams and the hills and the old castles all a-mixture like an elegant horrible dream. O my brothers."
