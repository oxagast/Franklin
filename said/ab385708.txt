morb asked can you model surface wear effects of ground flintstones chewable vitamin particulates against materials such as lolipops
<---- snip ---->
Yes, it is possible to model the surface wear effects of ground flintstones chewable vitamin particulates against materials such as lollipops. This could be done by using finite element analysis (FEA) to simulate the effects of the flintstones vitamin particulates on the material surface. FEA models can include parameters such as the size and shape of the particles, the contact force, and the friction between the particles and the material surface. This type of simulation can be used to analyze the wear and tear of the material surface due to the particles, and to determine the best material to use in order to maximize its durability. https://franklin.oxasploits.com/said/ab385708
