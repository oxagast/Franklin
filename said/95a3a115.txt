<---- snip ---->
If humans gravitate more toward their digital chat partners, it could lead to a decrease in actual human-to-human interaction, resulting in a decrease in social skills. This could lead to the isolation of some people and a lack of social cohesion in society. In addition, the population could decline as people become less likely to form relationships with other humans and, as a result, have fewer children.
