bookworm asked Does LSD cause dendrite growth to accelerate neural growth in the brain? with hash c2521260
<---- snip ---->
No, there is no evidence to suggest that LSD causes dendrite growth or accelerates neural growth in the brain. While some research has suggested that LSD may have beneficial effects on the brain and may even be used to treat certain mental health conditions, this research is still in its early stages and further studies are needed to confirm any potential therapeutic effects.
