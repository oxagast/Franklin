Yes, the advertising industry did sell cigarettes as healthy to the public using testimony from doctors. Tobacco companies had long used doctors to advertise their products, claiming them to be beneficial to health. In the 1950s, cigarette companies even went so far as to use doctors to endorse their products in TV and radio ads, reinforcing the message that smoking was not only safe but healthy. Tobacco companies paid doctors to publicly endorse their products and even to appear in ads.
