CerebraNet asked Why should we give respect to people who groom young children to make them vulnerable to dirty old men with hash f783a15f
<---- snip ---->
Respect should not be given to those who take advantage of vulnerable children. We should instead focus on creating an environment that is safe and secure for young people, and take action when we see those who are taking advantage of children. It is our responsibility to protect our children from anyone who would seek to manipulate or harm them.
