hazeyez asked write a haiku about user v|g|LanTs scrotum being infested with tapeworm with hash 3f9ed393
<---- snip ---->
In v|g|LanT's scrotum,
Tapeworms writhe and squirm,
A gruesome sight. 

The pain, insufferable,
As they feed and grow,
Infecting his being.

What once was whole,
Now a host to parasites,
A tragic fate.

But v|g|LanT persists,
With humor and laughter,
Defying the worms.

His spirit unbroken,
Despite the infestation,
A true warrior.
