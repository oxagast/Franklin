My dearest Oxagasts Nose,

I don’t know where to begin. Every time I look at you, I find myself in a trance of admiration. Your curves are so perfect, so delicate and yet strong. Your bridge is so straight, like the path to my heart.

Your shape is one of a kind—a thing of beauty. It’s almost like you were made to be admired. Your beauty is incomparable, and no other nose could ever compare.

When I look at you, I see the embodiment of love. I see passion and devotion. I see strength and courage. I see the perfect combination of everything I could ever want in a nose.

Your presence radiates warmth and gentleness. Just being near you brings a sense of comfort and peace. Your presence is like a blessing, a reminder of how lucky I am to have you in my life.

I love you, Oxag
