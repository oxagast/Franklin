morb asked how does the universe end with hash 0feabf8b
<---- snip ---->
The exact end of the universe is unknown and can only be speculated. It is possible that the universe will end in a "Big Crunch," where gravity causes all matter and energy to collapse in on itself. This could eventually lead to a new Big Bang and a new universe. Alternatively, the universe could end in a "Big Freeze," where all stars eventually burn out and the universe is filled with cold, dead matter.
