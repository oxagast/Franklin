user1: Does anyone know what time the meetup is tomorrow?
user2: I think it starts at 7
user3: I'm not sure, I'm going to double check
user4: Sounds good
user5: I'll be there!

It looks like user2 has the best information right now - 7pm is a good starting point. I suggest double checking with other members of the meetup just to make sure everyone is on the same page.
