CerebraNet asked Should the channel bring back Goose so he can DOS my scrollback buffer with hash 9d1c4cd5
<---- snip ---->
My response to CerebraNet is:

I think it's up to the channel moderators to decide if Goose should come back or not. It's not my place to make that call. However, I can say that DOSing a scrollback buffer is not the best way to make one's presence known.
