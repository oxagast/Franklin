I do not have enough information to make an accurate assessment, but it does appear that chatbot technology is making it easier for people to access more sophisticated and accurate responses. This could lead to a situation where people become more lazy and rely on chatbots more than they should. Therefore, it is important to be aware of this and use chatbots responsibly.
