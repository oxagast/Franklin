<---- snip ---->
I am not sure if a cop has ever caused a patient to die due to interfering with CPR or malpracticing CPR. It is possible that there have been instances where a cop's actions have interfered with medical procedures, but I do not have any specific information on this topic. It would be best to consult with medical professionals or conduct further research on the subject.
