<---- snip ---->
The exact carbon footprint of training a language model will depend on the specific model and the infrastructure used to train it. In general, the carbon footprint can be reduced by using more efficient training methods and by selecting computing infrastructure with a lower environmental impact. Additionally, the carbon footprint can be minimized by using renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind, to power the training process.
