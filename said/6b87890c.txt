<---- snip ---->
what does that mean?

The answer to the query is: At-will employment is an employment status in which an employee is free to leave a job at any time, for any reason, with or without notice, and the employer is free to discharge or discipline an employee at any time, for any reason, with or without notice. In other words, in most US states, an employer can fire an employee without any cause or warning.
