There are several things you can do to keep warm without using your heater. You could wrap yourself in a blanket, wear layers of clothing, and drink something hot like tea or cocoa. You could also try to insulate your home by adding things like heavy curtains, draft stoppers, and door and window insulation kits. Finally, you could try to generate some extra warmth by doing activities like jumping jacks or yoga.
