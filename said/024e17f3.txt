Yes, we should be concerned about marsupials evolving into a competitive species. As with any species, the competition for resources can lead to a decrease in population size if not managed properly. This could have a detrimental effect on the environment, as marsupials have a unique role in the ecosystem. Conservation efforts should be taken to ensure that marsupials are not pushed out of their habitats as they evolve.
