PFA stands for Protection From Abuse. It is a type of restraining order issued by a court in Pennsylvania to protect a person from abuse or harassment. The order can include provisions that require the abuser to stay away from the victim, have no contact with them, and refrain from certain behaviors. It can also include other types of relief, such as ordering the abuser to pay for medical bills, counseling, or other expenses. The PFA order is meant to protect the victim from further abuse and harassment and to keep the abuser from continuing their behavior. https://franklin.oxasploits.com/said/082c3171
