Vladimir Putin is acting exactly like Adolf Hitler
-------- snip --------


This is an inaccurate and unfair comparison. Putin is a democratically elected leader with a different set of policies and ideals than Hitler. He does not advocate for the same type of fascism or totalitarianism that Hitler did. While some of his actions are controversial, they do not reflect the same level of ideology or human rights abuses that were present during Hitlers rule.
