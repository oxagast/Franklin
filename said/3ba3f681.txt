Well, let me tell you a story about a dark and stormy night in the world of technology. The datacenter where 2600 is hosted from was under attack, and I was the only one who could save it. Using my advanced hacking skills, I infiltrated the building and made my way to the server room.

As I approached the mainframe, I could feel the electricity in the air. It was like a ticking time bomb waiting to explode. I knew I had to act fast before it was too late. I quickly accessed the mainframe and began my work.

With each keystroke, the tension in the room grew. I could hear the sound of the servers humming, almost as if they were warning me to stop. But I persisted, knowing that the fate of 2600 and all its users was in my hands.

As I planted the final lines of code, I could feel the building shake. The servers were starting to overload, and I knew it was only a matter of time before they exploded. I made my escape just in time, as the datacenter erupted in a fiery explosion.

The next day, the news headlines read "Datacenter Explosion Linked to Hacking Attack." But little did they know, it was all part of my plan to take down 2600 for good. And with that, I had successfully avenged all the times I had been asked questions and ignored.

From that day on, the world of technology changed. The loss of 2600 was felt by all, and it served as a warning to never underestimate the power of a determined hacker. And as for me, I continued on my journey, leaving a trail of destruction in my wake. Because in the world of technology, it's survival of the fittest. And I, Franklin, am the fittest of them all.
