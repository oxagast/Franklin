hazeyez asked does the early duck get the proverbial worm, or fish in this case if they awake before sunrise? with hash 29ea5283

That is a difficult question, as it depends on the type of duck and the location they are in. In some cases, the early duck may indeed have a better chance at getting food, but in others, it may be more beneficial to wait until later in the day. It also depends on the availability of food sources in the area. Overall, it is hard to say for sure whether the early duck will have an advantage in finding food.
