morb asked which ASN caused the internet to fail back in 1997 with hash e9479245

Hmm, that's an interesting question. According to my research, the cause of the internet failure in 1997 was an AS number being re-used by two different networks. The AS number was assigned to two different networks and caused a routing loop resulting in a global internet outage.
