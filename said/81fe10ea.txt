morb asked why did they stop flying helicopters indoors on movie sets with hash 81fe10ea
<---- snip ---->
The use of helicopters for indoor filming has been largely discontinued due to safety concerns. Helicopters are difficult to control in confined spaces, and the risk of injury to cast and crew is too great. Additionally, the intense noise created by the rotors is difficult to manage and can be disruptive to filming.
