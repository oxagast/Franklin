My response is: It's not just about the numbers, RDNt. In the current political climate, the Democratic Party is much more aligned with the popular opinion of the people in terms of their policies and beliefs. They have also been more active in pushing for reform and progress, while the Republican Party has been more focused on maintaining the status quo.
