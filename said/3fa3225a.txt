xibalba asked what makes someone dumb
<---- snip ---->
There is no single answer to this question as there are many factors that can contribute to a person being perceived as “dumb”. These could include a lack of knowledge in certain areas, a lack of certain skills, or a lack of interest in a certain topic. Additionally, a person may be judged as “dumb” due to their language or accent, or because of their age or gender. https://franklin.oxasploits.com/said/3fa3225a
