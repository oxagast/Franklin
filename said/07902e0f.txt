bookworm asked does bash auto file creation have standards with hash 07902e0f
<---- snip ---->
No, Bash does not have any specific standards for auto file creation. However, when creating an auto file, it is typically best practice to use a descriptive name and include the type of file (such as .txt) in the name. Additionally, it is also recommended to use a specific directory for the auto files to help keep them organized.
