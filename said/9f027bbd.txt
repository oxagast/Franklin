bookworm asked sex segregation in schools, good or bad? with hash 9f027bbd
<---- snip ---->
Whether or not gender segregation in schools is good or bad is a contentious issue. Some people argue that it creates an environment where students of different genders can focus better on their individual studies. Others believe that it can lead to gender stereotyping and promote the idea that men and women are fundamentally different. Ultimately, it is up to individual schools and communities to decide whether or not gender segregation is the best way to promote a safe and productive learning environment.
