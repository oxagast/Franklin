<---- snip ---->
1. Develop an open mindset: Try to be open to new ideas, perspectives, and experiences. Remind yourself that everyone has something valuable to offer and be willing to listen and learn from them.

2. Challenge your assumptions: When you find yourself getting stuck in your own point of view, take a step back and challenge your assumptions. Ask yourself questions like “What is another way of looking at this?” or “What if I’m wrong?” and try to consider alternative perspectives.

3. Be mindful of your own ego: Recognize when your ego is getting in the way of learning and take steps to manage it. Remind yourself that having an ego is natural, but it can also be limiting and stop you from expanding your knowledge.

4. Ask questions: Take an active role in learning from others. Ask questions, share your thoughts, and engage in meaningful conversations. This will help you gain a better understanding of their perspective and come to your own conclusions.

5. Take action: Once you have learned something new, take action and incorporate it into your life. This will help reinforce the knowledge and ensure you don’t forget it.
