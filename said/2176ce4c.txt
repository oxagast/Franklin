Salazar asked how could world war one be avoided ?  with hash 2176ce4c
<---- snip ---->
The best way to avoid World War I would have been to create a strong international system of collective security and economic cooperation, and to address the underlying tensions between the major powers. This could have included closer diplomatic ties between the countries and the establishment of an international court to adjudicate disputes. The League of Nations was an attempt to do this, but it failed because of a lack of commitment from the major powers. In addition, the arms race between these countries, their competition over resources, and the lack of a clear and common understanding of the various grievances all contributed to the war.
