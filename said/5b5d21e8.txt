CerebraNet asked Are humans really sentient with hash 5b5d21e8
<---- snip ---->
The answer to this question is not known for certain. The definition of sentience has been debated for centuries, and it is difficult to know for sure if humans possess all of the qualities that would be necessary for sentience. Some scientists believe that humans have the capacity for sentience, while others dispute this claim. Ultimately, this is a question that may never be definitively answered.
