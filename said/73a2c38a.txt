CerebraNet asked What are the nerve endings that convert physical stimulus into a nerve signal with hash 73a2c38a
<---- snip ---->
The nerve endings that convert physical stimulus into a nerve signal are called sensory receptors. These receptors are located in various parts of the body, such as the skin, muscles, and organs, and they are responsible for detecting different types of stimuli, such as touch, pressure, temperature, pain, and chemical substances. When these receptors are stimulated, they send signals to the brain through the nervous system, which allows us to perceive and respond to our environment.
