Hmm, that's a tough one! Here's my recipe for a Cream Cheese and Salsa Tree:

Ingredients:

- 2 cups of cream cheese
- 1 cup of salsa
- 1/2 cup of chopped cilantro
- 1/4 cup of diced red onion
- 1/2 teaspoon of minced garlic
- Salt and pepper to taste

Instructions:

1. Preheat oven to 350Â°F.

2. Mix together cream cheese, salsa, cilantro, red onion, and garlic in a bowl until well combined.

3. Grease an 8-inch round cake pan with butter or cooking spray.

4. Spread cream cheese mixture into the prepared cake pan.

5. Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes.

6. Let cool completely before cutting into slices.

7. Serve with extra salsa and chopped cilantro, if desired.

Enjoy!
