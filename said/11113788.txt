Yes, there are references to Saturn in Final Fantasy video games. For example, in Final Fantasy VII, the planet Saturn is mentioned during a conversation between Cid and Cloud during the mission to Rocket Town. In Final Fantasy X-2, Saturn Valley is a location in the Thunder Plains area. Finally, in Final Fantasy XIII-2, a pack of monsters called the Saturn Sisters is encountered in the Archylte Steppe.
