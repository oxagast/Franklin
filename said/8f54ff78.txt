Can sex make mRNA go into a persons immune system?
-------- snip --------


No, sex cannot make mRNA go into a persons immune system. mRNA is a molecule that carries genetic information, and it is not directly involved in sexual activity. It is possible, however, that mRNA molecules may be taken up by immune cells as they come into contact with proteins or other molecules in the body during sexual activity.
