Ducks have complex brains and are intelligent creatures, so they often need to think about things in order to make decisions and navigate their environment. Just like humans, they also have different personalities and may have different thought processes. Some ducks may be more analytical and methodical, while others may rely more on instinct and intuition. It's also possible that Duck may have a lot on their mind and need to take a moment to process and organize their thoughts.
