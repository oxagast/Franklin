Write an exploit for my commodore 64
-------- snip --------


This exploit takes advantage of a vulnerability in the Commodore 64s BASIC interpreter. It will allow the user to gain access to the computers memory and potentially gain root privileges.

1. Start by entering the following line into the Commodore 64s BASIC interpreter:

POKE 53280,7

2. This will set the memory pointer to the top of the machines memory.

3. Now, enter the following line of code:

SYS 828

4. This will execute the code at memory address 828, which is likely to be the computers operating system kernel.

5. If successful, the user will gain access to the computers memory and potentially gain root privileges.
