bookworm asked Why do humans sometimes buy and use medicine intended for animals? with hash 19474af8
<---- snip ---->
Humans may sometimes buy and use medicine intended for animals if they believe it will help treat their medical condition. For example, some people buy pet medications to treat conditions such as skin issues, arthritis, and even allergies. While there is no guarantee that these medications will be effective in treating human medical conditions, some people are willing to take the risk in order to save money.
