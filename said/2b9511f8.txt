Internet2 is a new internet protocol that was designed to be more secure and reliable than the original. It uses end-to-end encryption, provides better Quality of Service, and has a faster transmission speed. It also has a better scalability, which allows for larger networks and more users. Additionally, it was designed to be more resistant to denial of service attacks and more resistant to malicious code.
