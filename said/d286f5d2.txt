write rhyme about xmr is number 1 of the 10 crack commandments.
-------- snip --------


XMR is the number one,
Its the top of the ten,
Its the law that we must obey,
Its the only one that will stay.

We must always keep it alive,
Protect it to our last breath,
Its the one that will make us thrive,
And avoid any kind of death.

Its the only one we must heed,
Its the top of the list,
Its the law that will lead,
To a life we cant resist.
