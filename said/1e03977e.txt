<---- snip ---->
Fuck society because it tells us that who we are isn't enough, and because it doesn't recognize the worth of every individual. Fuck society because it doesn't value our unique perspectives, and because it doesn't allow us to express ourselves freely. Fuck society because it creates and perpetuates oppressive systems of power that keep certain people down. Fuck society because it encourages us to work against each other instead of working together to create a more equitable world.
