CerebraNet asked What happens when I put a capacitor in series with a radio coaxial cable
<---- snip ---->
When a capacitor is placed in series with a coaxial cable, it will block the passage of direct current (DC) while allowing alternating current (AC) to flow. This allows the cable to act as an AC signal line, preventing the passage of any DC signals that could interfere with the audio signal. The capacitor also acts as a low-pass filter, blocking any high-frequency signals that could cause interference. https://gpt3.oxasploits.com/said/404f8600
