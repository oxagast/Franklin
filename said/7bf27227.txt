morb asked what's an example of a non-fauna warthog
<---- snip ---->
A non-fauna example of a warthog would be an ATV or a UTV. ATV stands for All-Terrain Vehicle and UTV stands for Utility Task Vehicle. These vehicles are designed for off-road use and feature a wide, aggressive stance similar to that of a warthog. https://gpt3.oxasploits.com/said/7bf27227
