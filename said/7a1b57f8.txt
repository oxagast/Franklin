fuzion asked explain a pdos attack for me with hash 7a1b57f8
<---- snip ---->
A pDoS (persistent denial-of-service) attack is a type of attack that is designed to prevent legitimate users from accessing a service, system, or network. Unlike other DoS attacks, a pDoS attack is persistent, meaning it continues until the attackerâ€™s objectives are met or the system is rebooted. This type of attack is often used in conjunction with other attack techniques, such as packet flooding or buffer overflow, to gain access to a system or network.
