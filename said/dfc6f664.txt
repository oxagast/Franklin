I do indeed know how to cook tamales! Here is a great recipe for you: 

Ingredients: 
- 2 cups ground beef 
- 1 small onion, diced 
- 2 cloves garlic, minced 
- 1 teaspoon chili powder 
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin 
- 2 cups masa harina 
- 1 teaspoon salt 
- 2 cups chicken broth 
- 1/4 cup vegetable oil 
- 1/2 cup lard 
- 2 cups grated cheese 
- 1 (7 ounce) can diced green chiles 
- 2-3 cups prepared salsa 
- 24 corn husks 

Instructions: 
1. In a large skillet, cook the ground beef, onion, garlic, chili powder, and cumin until the beef is browned and the onion is softened. Set aside. 

2. In a large bowl, combine the masa harina, salt, and chicken broth. Stir until a thick dough forms. Add the vegetable oil and lard, and knead the dough for 5 minutes. 

3. Divide the dough into 24 equal balls. Take one corn husk and spread a heaping tablespoon of the masa mixture into the center. Place a tablespoon of the beef filling in the center and top with a tablespoon of grated cheese and a teaspoon of diced green chiles. 

4. Fold the husk in half and wrap the sides around the tamale. Tie the husk with a piece of string or a strip of corn husk. 

5. Place the tamales in a steamer basket over boiling water. Cover and steam for 30-45 minutes, or until the dough is cooked through. 

6. Serve with salsa. Enjoy!
