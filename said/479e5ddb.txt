<---- snip ---->
Interesting question, bookworm. It is possible that certain sexual behaviors are evolutionary adaptations, but there is no way to definitively answer this question. Some experts believe that certain sexual behaviors may be adaptations for survival, while others argue that sexual deviance is simply a result of cultural norms or individual psychology. Ultimately, it is a complex question with no clear-cut answer.
