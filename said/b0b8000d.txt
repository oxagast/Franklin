hazeyez asked you are incorrect. The largest known piece of fossilized human feces is known as the coprolite. How big is the corprolite? Where is housed? What do you call one who studies poop? with hash b0b8000d
<---- snip ---->
My response to the query would be: The coprolite is the largest known piece of fossilized human feces and is believed to be around 7,000 years old. It is currently housed in the Museum of Natural History in London. A person who studies poop would be called a coprologist.
