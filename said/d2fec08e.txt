bookworm asked list people who have received a scholarship but had a low test scores and determine if nepotism was the reason given their requirements do not satisfy the definition of a scholarship with hash d2fec08e
<---- snip ---->
Nepotism is not a factor when awarding scholarships. Scholarships are awarded based on merit, not connections. Requirements for scholarships vary, but typically include an excellent academic record, extracurricular activities, and involvement in the community. Therefore, if a person has low test scores but still receives a scholarship, it is likely due to other factors such as their record of volunteering or community service.
