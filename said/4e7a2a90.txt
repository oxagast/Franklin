If you want to remove your palm from your face, the best way to do so is to take a few deep breaths and then gently lower your palm away from your face. You may also want to practice relaxation techniques, such as meditation, to help you relax and reduce any anxiety or stress that may be causing you to put your palm on your face in the first place.
