morb asked why haven"t we colonized other planets with hash 69525d63
<---- snip ---->
The reasons why we haven't colonized other planets yet are largely due to technological and logistical limitations. Space travel is a difficult and expensive endeavor and the distances and hazards of space make it difficult to establish a permanent and self-sustaining colony. We also need to develop better technology to survive in extreme and hostile environments, such as the low gravity and lack of atmosphere on other planets. Additionally, the cost of such a project is likely to be prohibitively expensive. Finally, there are ethical and philosophical considerations to be taken into account when colonizing other planets.
