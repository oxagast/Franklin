Is it good to be kind to evil people?
-------- snip --------


It is generally better to be kind to evil people than to be cruel to them, but it is important to remember that kindness should not be taken as a sign of approval or acceptance of their actions. It is usually best to practice kindness, but also to make sure to express disapproval of the persons actions.
