<---- snip ---->
If all landlords evicted all tenants on Earth, it would cause widespread homelessness, as people would have nowhere to live and would have to rely on shelters, community services, and the generosity of family and friends for housing. This would put a huge strain on government and local community services. It would also have a huge economic impact, as people would no longer be able to pay rent or take out mortgages to buy homes. This would lead to a decrease in the demand for housing, leading to an overall decrease in the housing market. Furthermore, the lack of housing would cause an increase in poverty and inequality, as people would struggle to pay for basic necessities.
