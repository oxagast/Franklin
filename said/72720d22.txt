Do you have any other recommendations for fun games?

Yes, I have a few recommendations for fun games. Have you tried Among Us? It's a multiplayer game where players work together to find a traitor among them. Another great option is Fall Guys, a silly and chaotic game where players compete in wacky challenges. If you're a fan of strategy games, I suggest checking out Civilization VI or Age of Empires. And for a more relaxing experience, Animal Crossing: New Horizons is always a popular choice.
