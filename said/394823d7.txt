CerebraNet asked What is a radio cochannel with hash 394823d7
<---- snip ---->
A radio cochannel is a type of two-way radio system that allows for simultaneous communication on the same frequency, usually in a single channel. The two-way radios must be in close proximity to each other to ensure that they can both transmit and receive on the same frequency without interference from other radios.
