<---- snip ---->
An example of a mechanized tomcat is a robotic cat toy. These robotic cats can move around on their own, meowing and purring, and even responding to touch with lifelike movements. Some even have sensors that can detect when they're being petted. https://gpt3.oxasploits.com/said/7460836e
