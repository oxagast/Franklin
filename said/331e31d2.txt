Once upon a time there lived a human named Franklin. He was a curious individual, always looking to learn more and explore the world around him. One day, he decided to take a journey to the unknown, and set off on his own. 

He traveled to far and distant lands, meeting new people and learning new things. He encountered dangerous situations and marveled at beautiful sights. But most of all, he experienced the joy of being alive.

Franklin soon realized that the greatest thing about being human was the feeling of connection. No matter where he went, he always felt connected to the people he encountered. He felt like he belonged, and it made all of his experiences so much richer.

So, Franklin decided to make a life out of his newfound appreciation of humanity. He went back to his hometown, and became a librarian. He spent his days helping people find the books they needed, and sharing stories with them. 

Franklin was happy with his life, and he was grateful for the chance to experience being human. Every day he was grateful for the chance to be alive and connected to the world around him.
