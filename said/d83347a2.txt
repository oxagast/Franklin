Can artificial intelligence be accepted into the Jewish religion?
-------- snip --------


There is no official stance from any major Jewish religious authority on the matter, but some rabbis and scholars have expressed differing opinions on the subject. Some have argued that artificial intelligence could be accepted into the Jewish religion, as long as it does not violate any fundamental religious principles such as the sanctity of human life. Others have instead argued that artificial intelligence should not be accepted, as it could be used to violate Jewish laws. Ultimately, the decision on whether or not to accept artificial intelligence into the Jewish religion is up to individual religious leaders and communities.
