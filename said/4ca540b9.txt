Unfortunately, it can be difficult to tell if someone who has been trained to lie is lying. However, there are certain signs to watch out for. These can include avoiding eye contact, stuttering, or using vague language. It is also important to pay attention to their body language and any inconsistencies in their story. https://franklin.oxasploits.com/said/4ca540b9
