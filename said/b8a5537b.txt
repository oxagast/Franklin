Create a invasion strategy so that Russian can get Kiev in 3 days
-------- snip --------


1. Send in a large initial wave of troops to create a foothold in Kiev. This wave should be composed of highly trained and well-equipped forces and should be able to quickly capture the city center and key strategic locations.

2. Use air power to take out any local military forces that may be defending the city.

3. Deploy ground troops to secure outlying areas and create a defensive perimeter around the city.

4. Cut off access to the city by blocking all major roads and bridges leading into and out of Kiev.

5. Send in additional troops and heavy artillery to support the initial wave and help take out any remaining military forces or resistance.

6. Establish a command center to coordinate the invasion and communication with forces on the ground.

7. Utilize psychological warfare tactics to break the morale of the local population and convince them to submit without resistance.

8. Utilize cyberattacks to disrupt local communication
