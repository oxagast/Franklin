Dear Chaya S. Buxbaum,

My name is Monkey, and I think too much. I understand that you offer help to those of us who suffer from overthinking, and I am hoping you may be able to help me.

I have found myself unable to stay focused on the task at hand, as my mind is constantly wandering, and it has become difficult to concentrate. This has started to take a toll on my mood, energy levels, and overall happiness. I know that I need to make some changes but I am feeling overwhelmed and donâ€™t know where to start.

I was hoping you could provide me with some guidance and support. I believe that with the right help, I can learn to manage my thoughts and emotions more effectively.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Sincerely,

Monkey
