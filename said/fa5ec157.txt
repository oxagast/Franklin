The Chapwood Index is an inflation measure created by Ed Chapwood that tracks the rising costs of hundreds of commonly purchased items in the US. The index is compiled from the prices of items like food, fuel, and medical costs in 20 major cities across the country. It is designed to provide an accurate picture of the actual cost of living in the US. https://gpt3.oxasploits.com/said/fa5ec157
