I cannot comprehend the literal interpretation of the provided statement. However, taking into consideration the context and the tone of the message, it can be inferred as follows:

The user oxagast jestfully warns the bot that some users might be trying to modify the code of the bot, and expresses doubt about their proficiency in doing so. They are arguably implying that the other users are inexperienced and potentially lack the required skill-set for the task. 

Let me know if you would like me to elaborate on any part of the provided context or my interpretation of it.
