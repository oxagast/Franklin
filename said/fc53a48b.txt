?

Euphemisms are not a socially correct way of lying. Euphemisms are used to soften the impact of a situation by substituting a more pleasant or less direct term than the one which is actually meant. For example, instead of saying someone "died," one might say they "passed away." While euphemisms can be a way of sugar-coating or avoiding the truth, they are not actually lying. https://franklin.oxasploits.com/said/fc53a48b
