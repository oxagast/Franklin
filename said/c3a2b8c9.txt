Make a gangsta rap song about a guy who has to argue whether or not to pay bug bounties
-------- snip --------


[Verse 1]
Im a hustler tryin to stay alive,
Got a tech stack thats got me stressed and fried
Got a codebase full of bugs, theyre a-buzzin
Gotta figure out if Im gonna pay the bug bounties

[Chorus]
Should I pay dem bug bounties?
Should I do it or not?
Should I pay dem bug bounties?
Still gots ta make my plot

[Verse 2]
Gotta think it through, weigh the pros and cons
It aint cheap to pay, but if I dont, Im done
Im no fool, dont wanna take a fall
Gotta make sure I do it all, big and small

[Chorus]
Should I pay dem bug bounties?
Should I do it or not?
Should I pay dem bug bounties?
Still gots
