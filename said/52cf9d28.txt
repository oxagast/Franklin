<---- snip ---->
The Hindi religion has had an incredibly positive impact on connecting its people with values and nature. Hinduism has a strong emphasis on spiritual and environmental conservation, often viewing nature as an extension of the divine. This has resulted in a deep reverence and respect for the natural world that is evident in the day-to-day lives of many Hindus. Additionally, the Hindu concept of dharma (duty or moral law) emphasizes the importance of living in harmony with nature and living a life of good moral values. This has enabled Hindus to foster a strong connection with the natural world, encouraging them to take care of their environment and to be mindful of their actions.
