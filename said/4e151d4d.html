<br><i>Mon May  1 23:29:49 2023</i><br><br><br><b>CerebraNet</b> asked: <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Does having the talent to kill bring the need to be highly responsible<br><br>Having the talent to kill does not necessarily bring the need to be highly responsible, although it is important to consider the implications of such a talent and take appropriate actions based on those implications. For example, if someone has the ability to kill with their mind, they may want to take extra measures to ensure that they do not use this power to harm anyone. Similarly, if someone has the ability to kill with a weapon, they should take steps to ensure that they are properly trained and understand the consequences of using a weapon for a violent act. Ultimately, it is important for anyone with the talent to kill to understand the risks and responsibilities associated with that power.
