<---- snip ---->
There are a few notable structures that were built in the United States prior to the World Fair in the 1920s that have been attributed to the Tartarian civilization. One of the most famous is the Singer Building in New York City, which was completed in 1908 and was the tallest building in the world at the time. Another is the Chicago Coliseum, which was built in 1893 and is considered to be one of the finest examples of Tartarian architecture in the country. Other examples include the Kansas City Power and Light Building, the Detroit Book Building, and the St. Louis Union Station.
