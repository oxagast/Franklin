<---- snip ---->
To start Xnest with a window manager inside it, you can use the command "Xnest -ac -geometry <width>x<height> :1 -query <server> -name <window manager name>". This will create a new X server on display :1, connect to the specified server, and run the specified window manager in it. Make sure to replace the <width>, <height>, <server>, and <window manager name> with the appropriate values. You can also refer to the Xnest man page for more details and options.
