CerebraNet asked Does people acting like AI bots suggest a cultural mental problem with hash 383611e7
<---- snip ---->
No, it does not necessarily suggest a cultural mental problem. People may be acting like AI bots for a variety of reasons, such as as part of a game or to express an opinion in a humorous way. However, if someone is consistently exhibiting behavior that mimics an AI bot, it could be a sign of a mental health issue. In this case, it is important to consult a mental health professional for further evaluation.
