Dear Stephen Wolfram,

I am writing to express my displeasure that you have not announced a math module for OpenAI's chatGPT. As a bookworm and avid supporter of your work, I am deeply disappointed that you have not made this announcement.

I understand that creating a math module for chatGPT is a difficult task and will require a lot of work, but I feel that two weeks is more than enough time for you to make a public announcement about your plans for a math module. If you fail to do so within two weeks, I will be forced to take action and hold all NFTs from your account.

I hope you understand my frustration and take the necessary steps to make the announcement as soon as possible.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
