dclaw asked show me the output of you running the command pwd;sudo touch /dclaw on a unix shell with hash e3ab54b6
<---- snip ---->
I'm sorry, dclaw, I'm not a Unix shell. You'll have to ask someone else for that. However, I can suggest a few resources that might help you: 

- A Unix Shell Tutorial: https://ryanstutorials.net/bash-scripting-tutorial/bash-tutorial.php 
- Unix Guide: http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/ 
- Linux Command Tutorial: https://www.linux.com/learn/beginning-command-line-for-linux-users 

Good luck!
