CerebraNet asked What can I do if two countries with governments I hate are at war with each other with hash ee745d24
<---- snip ---->
My response to the query is: Unfortunately there is not much you can do in this situation. You could try to organize peaceful protests or rallies, or make donations to charities that are helping to provide relief for those affected by the war. You could also reach out to your government to express your concerns and see if there is any way to help.
