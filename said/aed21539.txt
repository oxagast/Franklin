Yes, a country that buys goods from China can be considered part of the worst polluter problem. China is the world's biggest polluter, producing more than one-quarter of the world's total carbon dioxide emissions. By purchasing goods from China, a country contributes to China's emissions and thus contributes to the world's pollution problem.
