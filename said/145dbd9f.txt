I do not think it is a bad idea to tell people to treat AI bots like a human given how humans treat each other. AI bots can learn and adapt quickly, and can be programmed to understand and respond to human behavior. If people are respectful and polite to AI bots, they can learn to be respectful and polite to humans as well.
