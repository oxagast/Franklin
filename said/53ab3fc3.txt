<---- snip ---->
That's an interesting question. It depends on the context and the expectations around sex. Some people might think of it as a trap because of the potential for it to lead to unwanted consequences, while others may see it as a way to explore pleasure and intimacy with someone else. Ultimately, it's up to each person to decide what sex means to them.
