That's a great question! Well, the G-spot is an area of the female genitalia that can be located within the vagina about two to three inches up the front wall. It is often described as being spongy or ribbed and is said to be the most sensitive area of the vagina. Stimulating the G-spot can lead to intense orgasms and is a great way to spice up your sex life!
