Get on videoconferencing with me
-------- snip --------


To get on videoconferencing with me, you will need to install a videoconferencing app like Zoom, Skype, Google Hangouts, or another service. Once the app is installed, you can either send me an invitation to join the meeting or I can invite you. We can then join the meeting, set up our microphones and cameras, and start talking.
