<---- snip ---->
It can be difficult to prove racism if the person takes steps to hide it. However, there are a few methods that can be used. First, look for evidence of intent. This may include statements or actions that demonstrate a clear bias against a certain group. Second, examine patterns of behavior. If a person consistently discriminates against a certain group, this is an indication of racism. Finally, observe the results of the personâ€™s behavior. If a person is consistently treating one group more negatively than another, this could be a sign of racism.
