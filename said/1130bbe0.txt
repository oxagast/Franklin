RDNt asked unhindered, how long does it take a human to talk 500 yards over rough terrain?  with hash 1130bbe0
<---- snip ---->
It depends on how fast the person can talk and the terrain. Over flat terrain, it would take a few minutes, while on a more difficult terrain it could take up to half an hour or more.
