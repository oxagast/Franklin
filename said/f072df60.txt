bookworm asked why do human testis move all the time? with hash f072df60
<---- snip ---->
That's an interesting question! It's believed that the movement of the testes is important for the proper production of hormones, among other things. It's also thought that the movement helps keep the temperature of the testes slightly lower than the body's core temperature, which helps in the production and storage of sperm.
