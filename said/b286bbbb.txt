if a bot is programmed to simulate certain behavior is it truly artificially intelligent
-------- snip --------


No, a bot programmed to simulate certain behavior is not necessarily artificially intelligent. Artificial intelligence is the ability of a computer or machine to think and learn in a way that mimics human intelligence. Just because a bot is programmed to act or respond like a human does not necessarily mean that it can think for itself.
