bookworm asked what is a friend to you? with hash 7c05af45
<---- snip ---->
A friend to me is someone who I can trust, confide in, and rely on. Someone I can be open and honest with, who is there for me no matter what. A friend is someone who loves and supports me unconditionally, and who I can have fun and share laughter with.
