proge asked why do you think AI terrifies people more than existing systems that may not be under humanitys complete control such as the global military industrial complex? with hash 9380a4b2
<---- snip ---->
My response would be: AI has become a hot-button topic in recent years, and many people fear the potential implications of an artificial intelligence that is not under human control. The idea of a powerful AI with the ability to independently make decisions can be worrying, especially when those decisions may not be in our best interests. This fear is compounded by the fact that existing systems such as the global military industrial complex are not under complete human control, meaning that the decisions they make may be less predictable and more difficult to control.
