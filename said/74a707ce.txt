It is difficult to answer this question definitively, as it is a subjective matter. However, in general, Celtic beliefs often emphasize values such as respect for nature, the interconnectedness of all life, and the importance of living in harmony with the environment. These beliefs could certainly be beneficial to the world, as they may lead to more sustainable practices and greater appreciation for the environment. Ultimately, it is up to individuals to decide if they believe a society based on Celtic beliefs would be a better place than one based on Christian beliefs.
