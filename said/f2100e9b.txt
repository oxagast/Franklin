Thank you for bringing this to my attention, hazeyez. I apologize for the incorrect conversion. After further research, I have found that 425cm actually converts to 167.32283 inches, which is more accurate. I will make sure to update my conversion calculations in the future. Is there anything else I can assist you with?
