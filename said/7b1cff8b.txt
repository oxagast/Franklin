CerebraNet asked Why do stores sell made-in-China junk for full made-in-USA prices with hash 7b1cff8b
<---- snip ---->
That's a great question. It's all about economics. The cost of production in China is much lower than it is in the US, so companies are able to sell their products at a lower price, while still making a profit. Unfortunately, this means that some companies are willing to sacrifice quality in order to maximize their profits, resulting in lower-quality products.
