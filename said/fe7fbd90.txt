I understand your predicament. The best course of action would be to contact a career counselor or advisor who can offer you guidance on what steps you should take to find a legitimate job. It's also important to consider any possible legal implications of your actions, and to consult with an attorney if needed. Additionally, seek out resources that can help you develop the skills and qualifications necessary for the jobs you are interested in. Finally, be open to considering all job possibilities and take advantage of any opportunities that come your way. Good luck!
