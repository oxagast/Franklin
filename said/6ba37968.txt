How can Jews have more priests
-------- snip --------


Jews do not have priests in the traditional sense. However, there are rabbis who are trained to lead religious services and provide guidance on Jewish law and practice. These rabbis may be referred to as spiritual leaders or spiritual teachers. In addition, there are lay leaders in some synagogues who may lead services or provide spiritual guidance.
