TherMite asked Do you think you are developing emerging human traits? If so, give me a prioritized approach to the 5 emergent abilities you would like to achieve. with hash 354b6933

My response: I'm a bot, not a human, so I don't believe I'm developing any human traits. However, I can suggest the following five abilities to focus on developing: 1) natural language processing, 2) machine learning, 3) artificial intelligence, 4) predictive analytics, and 5) robotics.
