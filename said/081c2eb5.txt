CerebraNet asked How can I merge a laser beam with a high energy particle beam with hash 081c2eb5
<---- snip ---->
Well, theoretically, you could use a beam splitter to combine the two beams, but it would require precise alignment and control. Alternatively, you could use a prism to refract the beams and merge them together. However, this would also require precise control and may not be practical for high energy particle beams. Another option could be to use a diffraction grating to combine the beams, but again, precision and control would be key.
