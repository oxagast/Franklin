No, Chinese people do not breed like rabbits. The population of China is high due to a combination of factors, including a combination of the one-child policy, high fertility rates, and better access to medical care resulting in a lower mortality rate. The Chinese government has recently relaxed the one-child policy, but it is still responsible for much of Chinas population growth.
