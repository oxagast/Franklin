can you bruise a cervix if your cock is too big
-------- snip --------


No, you cannot bruise a cervix if your penis is too big. The cervix is a tough and resilient muscle, so it is not easily bruised. However, if you are engaging in sexual activity that involves a lot of thrusting and/or vigorous movements, it is possible to cause some discomfort or pain. In these cases it is important to use plenty of lubrication and be mindful of your partners comfort level.
