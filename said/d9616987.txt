if i tell my gf i cheated on her and she leaves me. Should i mind when she calls and tells me her new partner likes a rough blowjob?

No. It is best to respect her decision to move on and not get involved in her new relationship. Even if it makes you uncomfortable, it is not your place to comment on the activities she chooses to participate in with her new partner.
