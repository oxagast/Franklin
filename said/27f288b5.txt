 due to age

If humans eliminated death due to age, it would create a population crisis. With no natural way to regulate the population, it would quickly become overpopulated and resources would be scarce. This could lead to social unrest, famine, and chaos. It could also have a significant environmental impact, as the strain on resources would be too great for the planet to sustainably support.
