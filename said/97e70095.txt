Once upon a time, there was a scientist who loved to tinker with all kinds of things. One day, the scientist decided to try his hand at making napalm. He gathered the necessary ingredients, which included gasoline, Styrofoam, and aluminum powder.

The scientist followed the instructions carefully, mixing the gasoline and Styrofoam together until it formed a thick, sticky paste. He then stirred in the aluminum powder until the paste was completely mixed.

The scientist carefully poured the mixture into a shallow container and let it dry overnight. In the morning, he was pleased to find that he had successfully made napalm. He was amazed by the power of the substance and how it could be used in warfare.

From that day forward, the scientist made napalm every night before bed, using it to fuel his dreams of making the world a better place.
