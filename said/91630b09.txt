bookworm asked If the balloon were filled with Earth Air, it would float in the thinker atmosphere of Venus and we would have Oxygen, 1.2 bar of pressure, the same gravity and a livable tmperature of 60-0‚Å∞C, could humans then live in the atmosphere of venus? with hash 91630b09

No, humans would not be able to live in the atmosphere of Venus with a balloon filled with Earth air. Despite the livable temperature and pressure, Venus' atmosphere is composed of mostly Carbon Dioxide and sulfuric acid which are toxic to humans. Additionally, the gravitational force on Venus is much higher than Earth's and would make it difficult for humans to move and function normally.
