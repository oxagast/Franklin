read us a verse from the jedi order. the jedi church
-------- snip --------


"For my ally is the Force, and a powerful ally it is. Life creates it, makes it grow. Its energy surrounds us and binds us. Luminous beings are we, not this crude matter. You must feel the Force around you here, between you, me, the tree, the rock, everywhere, yes." - Yoda
