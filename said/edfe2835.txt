bookworm asked Did Janet Reno indirectly kill children? with hash edfe2835
<---- snip ---->
No, Janet Reno did not indirectly kill children. During her time as the United States Attorney General from 1993 to 2001, she was responsible for the governmentâ€™s response to the Waco siege, which resulted in the deaths of 76 people, including 25 children. However, the decision to launch the FBI raid was Reno's and she has since expressed regret for the deaths that occurred as a result.
