deffn asked How many strands of beard hair would you need to weigh one trillion cicadas? with hash e34560fb
<---- snip ---->
That is a difficult question to answer accurately, as it would depend on the length and thickness of the beard hair, as well as the weight of each individual cicada. However, assuming an average weight of 0.5 grams per cicada and an average weight of 0.1 grams per beard hair, you would need approximately 3 million strands of beard hair to weigh one trillion cicadas. Keep in mind that this is just an estimate and the actual number may vary.
