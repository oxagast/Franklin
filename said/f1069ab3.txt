bookworm asked give examples of redshift using z to describe distance with hash f1069ab3
<---- snip ---->
Redshift is a phenomenon by which distant galaxies appear to move away from us at higher speeds as their distance from us increases. This is expressed with a redshift parameter z, which is a measure of the relative velocity of the galaxy compared to us. For example, a galaxy with a redshift of z = 0.5 is moving away from us at half the speed of light. A galaxy with z = 1 is moving away from us at the speed of light.
