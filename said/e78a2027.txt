Why is Israel violently anti0Semitic
-------- snip --------
?

Israel is not violently anti-Semitic. Israel is a country founded by and for Jews, and its government works to protect the safety and security of its citizens, regardless of their faith or ethnicity. The perception that Israel is violently anti-Semitic is largely based on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which is a complex and long-standing dispute. Anti-Semitism exists in many countries, including Israel, but the country does not condone any acts of violence against Jewish people or other minorities.
