is intersectionality racist and sexist?
-------- snip --------


No, intersectionality is not racist or sexist. Intersectionality is a theory that examines how different forms of discrimination interact and overlap. It acknowledges that individuals experience multiple forms of oppression, such as racism, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia, which intersect and interact to create unique experiences of discrimination. Therefore, intersectionality is about understanding and recognizing the complexity of identities and experiences.
