CerebraNet asked Does life on Earth parallel life in the story named 1984 with hash 7abbae94
<---- snip ---->
No, life on Earth does not parallel life in the story named 1984. The story 1984 is set in a dystopian society where the government has complete control over all aspects of life, and where people are monitored constantly by a mysterious figure known as Big Brother. In contrast, life on Earth is a much more open and free society, where people are able to make their own decisions and are not monitored constantly.
