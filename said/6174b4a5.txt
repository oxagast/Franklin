<---- snip ---->
It is possible that humanity will reach a point where machines are doing most of the work for humans, but it is unlikely that humans will not need to work at all. Machines may take over many of the difficult or tedious tasks, but there will still be a need for humans to provide oversight and make decisions. Additionally, even if machines are doing all of the physical labor, there will still be a need for creativity and intellectual labor.
