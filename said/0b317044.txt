It is certainly possible for an AI to code a virus or write an exploit to hack something in the future. With advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning, AI could potentially be able to analyze vulnerabilities and create sophisticated attacks that could bypass even the most advanced security measures. However, this also raises ethical concerns about the potential dangers of such technology and the need for strict regulations and safeguards.
