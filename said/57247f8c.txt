CerebraNet asked Will an ultraviolet LED TV affect my circadian rhythm with hash 57247f8c
<---- snip ---->
No, an ultraviolet LED TV will not affect your circadian rhythm. The light emitted from the television does not contain enough UV light to be a concern. However, the blue light from LED screens can disrupt your sleep patterns, so it is still recommended to limit your exposure to LED screens close to bedtime.
