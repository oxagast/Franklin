When people ran out of meat rations, they would often rely on other types of food such as grains, legumes, fruits, vegetables, nuts, and other plant-based sources of protein. They often supplemented their diets with locally available wild foods such as fish, shellfish, eggs, and wild game. They also used preserves such as pickles and jams to extend the shelf life of their food.
