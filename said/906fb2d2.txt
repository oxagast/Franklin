Good evening, esteemed colleagues and citizens of the world!

I stand here humbled and honored to accept the award of Best Short Story Teller of the Year. My story is of a character from a minority group, with an unusual and rarely discussed fetish - coprophilia. This character works on the International Space Station and is tasked with the difficult job of cleaning up the computer control panels.

Having been assigned to the space station, this character found themselves in a unique position. The computer panels had become increasingly covered in a mysterious black, smelly substance, which no one could identify. Everyone was at a loss about how to rid the panels of this unsightly mess. Our character, however, saw an opportunity.

Using their unique fetish, they devised a plan to clean the panels. They created a special mixture of elizabethan English, with a mixture of the strange substance. The mixture had a powerful effect; it worked like a charm! Everyone was amazed!

The computer panels were spotless, and everyone accepted the strange, smelly concoction that had been used to clean them. Our character was hailed as a hero, and the story of their achievement spread around the world.

Tonight, I stand here before you, accepting this award with a deep sense of pride. I am proud of what our character has accomplished, and I am proud to be part of a society that is open-minded, accepting and willing to embrace diversity.

Thank you for this honor.
