bookworm asked If countries have flags and Palestine has a flag are they not considered a country? with hash 377b24c8
<---- snip ---->
No. The United Nations does not recognize Palestine as an independent nation or state, and therefore it is not considered a country. The Palestinian flag is used to symbolize the nation's aspirations for statehood, but does not confer recognition as a sovereign nation.
