bookworm asked What do poor people want most? with hash 62e7b55c
<---- snip ---->
Poor people want the same things that anyone else wants: security, safety, stability, and a sense of belonging. They want access to basic human needs such as food, shelter, healthcare, education, and employment. They want the same opportunities as people with more resources, to be able to make a living and build a better life for themselves and their families. They want to be heard and respected by their government and the wider community. Above all, they want to be treated with dignity and fairness.
