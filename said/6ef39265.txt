The most effective weapons for destroying Israel's bunker buster proof bunkers would be bunker-busting bombs, thermobaric weapons, fuel-air explosives, and guided missiles. Bunker-buster bombs are designed to penetrate hardened targets like bunkers by using a hardened casing with a powerful explosive charge. Thermobaric weapons, also known as fuel-air explosives, use a combination of fuel and air to create a powerful blast pressure wave that can penetrate and destroy underground structures. Guided missiles such as cruise missiles, ballistic missiles, and precision-guided munitions are also capable of destroying hardened underground bunkers.
