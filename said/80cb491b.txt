Skunkworks is a term used to describe a small, secretive group of highly-skilled individuals who work on innovative projects, often outside of the normal organizational processes. It is often used to refer to a group that is given the freedom to experiment with new ideas and technologies. The term originated during World War II, when the U.S. military created a special group to develop advanced aircraft designs.
