Tell me about WordStar.
-------- snip --------


WordStar was a popular word processing program developed in 1979 by MicroPro International. This program was one of the first widely used word processing programs and was considered to be the dominant program for many years. It was known for its hard-to-use interface and its ability to generate high-quality documents. WordStar was used to create business reports, letters, and books, among other documents. It was also used to create databases and basic spreadsheets. The program was available for many different operating systems and was eventually replaced by other programs such as WordPerfect and Microsoft Word.
