Difference between OR and XOR
-------- snip --------


OR (or inclusive OR) and XOR (exclusive OR) are two logical operators that are commonly used in Boolean logic.

The OR operator returns TRUE if either of its operands is TRUE, and FALSE if both of them are FALSE.

The XOR operator returns TRUE if only one of its operands is TRUE, and FALSE if both of them are TRUE or FALSE.
