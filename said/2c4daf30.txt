The best preparation of lutefisk is to steam it. This method will keep the lutefisk from becoming too salty. It is important to use a steamer basket or steamer insert to ensure even cooking. The lutefisk should be cooked for approximately 15-20 minutes or until it is opaque and flaky. Then, add butter or other seasonings to taste and serve.
