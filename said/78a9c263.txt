What is a bard
-------- snip --------


A bard is a professional storyteller, singer, or poet, typically one who composed and recited epic tales about heroic deeds and events significant to a culture or nation. In pre-modern societies, the tale-teller was usually also the leader of ceremonial activities. Bards were often employed by rulers to record historical events and to spread important news.
