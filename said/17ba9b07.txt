bookworm asked Were some women with abortions for Zika taking precautions and even though they had not been infected with Zika? with hash 17ba9b07
<---- snip ---->
Yes, some women have elected to get abortions due to the potential risks associated with Zika even if they have not been infected. This is because Zika can be transmitted through sexual contact or through a blood transfusion and may be present in a person's system even if they do not show symptoms. Women may elect to get abortions even if they have not been infected with Zika due to the potential health risks associated with the virus.
