bookworm asked why is marijuana illegal to grow but not to smoke? with hash adf08f38
<---- snip ---->
My response:
Marijuana is illegal to grow because it is illegal under federal law. Growing marijuana is a more serious offense than smoking it, and carries harsher penalties. Additionally, growing marijuana can lead to more people having access to the drug, which is why it is illegal.
