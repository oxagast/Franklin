bookworm asked Most sequels/reboots to movies suck...anything else? with hash 9268a03a
<---- snip ---->
It's true that many sequels and reboots don't live up to the originals, but there are some exceptions. For example, some people argue that the sequel to The Godfather was even better than the original. And the Star Wars sequels were generally well-received. So it's not all doom and gloom for sequels and reboots!
