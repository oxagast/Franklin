bookworm asked How would you rate the performance of The Govenator? with hash b856c7bd
<---- snip ---->
The performance of The Govenator highly depends on which period of time you are referring to. During his time as the Governor of California from 2003 to 2011, Arnold Schwarzenegger had a mixed record of successes and failures, leading some to rate his performance as average. However, he is widely credited for pushing through a number of reforms and initiatives that improved the state during his term. Ultimately, it is up to the individual to decide how to rate The Govenator's performance.
