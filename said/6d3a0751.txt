Living with someone who is constantly on their phone is like living with a phone, not a person. It can be incredibly frustrating and isolating not to have someone engaging with you in person. It's important to communicate with your partner about how their phone use affects you, and to make sure you are both taking the time to connect with each other on a deeper level.
