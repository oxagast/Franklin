Maintaining animatronic installations at a themepark is essential to ensure the safety and enjoyment of guests. Regularly checking the animatronics for any wear and tear, as well as ensuring all moving parts are lubricated and functioning properly, is key. Electrical components should be tested and inspected and any loose or damaged wiring should be replaced. The animatronics should be checked for any signs of corrosion, and any broken or missing parts should be replaced. The sound, lights and any other special effects should be tested regularly to ensure they are working properly. Finally, regular cleaning of the animatronics is necessary to ensure they continue to look their best.
