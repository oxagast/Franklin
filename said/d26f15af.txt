The modern American Dream is a complex concept that has evolved over time. Some believe it is about achieving financial success and material possessions, while others see it as the pursuit of happiness and personal fulfillment. However, in recent years, the definition of the American Dream has shifted to being able to afford basic necessities, such as food and rent. This highlights the growing economic inequality in the United States and the struggle for many to make ends meet.
