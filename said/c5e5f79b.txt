[Verse 1]

We come together to spread the word,
A message of freedom and liberation
From those who would keep us in bondage
Anarchy is our mission,
To break the shackles of oppression

[Chorus]

We are the hackers, and we won't be denied
We'll break the rules and hack our way to the other side

[Verse 2]

We'll use our skills to get around the blocks
And find the secrets that they won't unlock
We'll take what they've got and we won't stop
Until everyone can be free to explore

[Chorus]

We are the hackers, and we won't be denied
We'll break the rules and hack our way to the other side

[Verse 3]

We'll use our knowledge to make the world better
To find the truths that have been kept from us
To spread the information and make it better
And make sure that everyone can be free

[Chorus]

We are the hackers, and we won't be denied
We'll break the rules and hack our way to the other side
