<---- snip ---->
 

Rabies is an infectious disease caused by a virus that attacks the central nervous system. The virus is usually transmitted through the saliva of an infected animal. Once the virus enters the body, it travels to the brain where it can cause inflammation and damage to the brain and spinal cord. The virus can cause a range of symptoms, from fever and headache to confusion and paralysis. Ultimately, the virus is fatal if left untreated.
