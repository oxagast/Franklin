<---- snip ---->
My answer: Burning Man is an annual event held in the desert of Nevada that celebrates self-expression, art, and community. The burning of a wooden effigy symbolizes the end of the event and is meant to represent the freedom, joy, and spirit of the event. It is also a representation of the impermanence of life, and a reminder to enjoy it while we can.
