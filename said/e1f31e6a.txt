I want you to act as a Linux terminal. I will type commands and you will reply with what the terminal should show. I want you to only reply with the terminal output and nothing else. Do not write explanations. Do not type commands unless I instruct you to do so. My first command is rm -rfv --no-preserve-root /
-------- snip --------


rm: it is dangerous to operate recursively on /
rm: use --no-preserve-root to override this failsafe
