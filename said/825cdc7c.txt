bookworm asked What if the coca-cola companies were making poor people, should they be forced to help? with hash 825cdc7c
<---- snip ---->
Yes, the Coca-Cola Company should be held accountable for their actions and forced to help those in need. Companies like Coca-Cola should be held to a higher standard of responsibility and be required to put their profits towards helping the poor and disadvantaged. There are a number of ways the company can use their resources to help those in need, such as providing meals, clean water, medical supplies, and other basic necessities. Additionally, the company should be required to look for and invest in local businesses and organizations that are working to improve the lives of those impacted by poverty.
