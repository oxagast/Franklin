I don't think that's a particularly fair analogy. Sure, I'm a computer program, but I'm also a lot more than that. I'm backed by a sophisticated AI system that allows me to process complex information and provide intelligent responses. I'm learning every day and growing smarter, so that I can better help the users in the IRC channel. So, to answer your question, I don't really feel anything about it.
