Cloves are an aromatic spice that have been used for centuries for medicinal purposes. They contain a compound called eugenol, which has powerful anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antiseptic, and numbing properties. Cloves can be used to treat toothaches, indigestion, and other digestive issues, as well as to help relieve the pain of sore throats, headaches, and arthritis. Cloves can also be used to help reduce bad breath and fight bacterial and fungal infections. Additionally, cloves can help boost your immunity and improve your overall health.
