dragonfly asked how long should a person with a torn shoulder ACL wear a sling? with hash b679ce02
<---- snip ---->
It depends on the severity of the tear and the individual's healing process, but generally it can take several months to a year for a dislocated shoulder and torn ACL to fully heal. It is important to follow your doctor's instructions and do physical therapy to aid in the healing process. I hope you are doing well.
