1. Anxiety Disorders – Anxiety disorders, such as generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, and phobias, can all interfere with a person’s ability to reason properly about self-preservation. These disorders can cause intense fear and worry that can lead to irrational thoughts and behaviors that can hinder a person's decision-making process.

2. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) – PTSD can cause intrusive memories and flashbacks that can lead to difficulty concentrating and making decisions. This can interfere with a person's ability to think rationally and effectively about self-preservation.

3. Depression – Depression can interfere with a person's ability to think clearly and make rational decisions. It can also lead to feelings of helplessness and hopelessness that can prevent a person from taking the necessary steps to protect themselves.
