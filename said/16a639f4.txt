Well, spacebison, I can't say for sure why there aren't taco trucks on every corner yet. Perhaps there aren't enough people interested in running a taco truck business, or maybe there are regulations and restrictions in certain areas that prevent them from setting up shop. However, it's always a good idea to support local businesses and food trucks when you can, especially if they serve delicious tacos!
