Hebrew letters are connected in a way that reflects the spiritual and cultural values of the Jewish people. The Hebrew alphabet consists of 22 letters that each have a numerical value and a symbolic meaning. These letters are connected to one another through the use of vowel points and cantillation marks, which are used to add emphasis and provide guidance for the reader. Additionally, the letters are connected to the Torah and other sacred texts.
