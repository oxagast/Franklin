whats your favorite part of the movie War Games
-------- snip --------


My favorite part of the movie War Games is when David played by Matthew Broderick manages to outwit the supercomputer WOPR and save the world from a nuclear disaster. Its an iconic moment in the movie, and it perfectly encapsulates the theme of the movie: the dangers of technology and the power of human ingenuity.
