write a gay pride poem that mocks eminem and says he is gay with tim westwood
-------- snip --------


Verse 1:
"Whats wrong with Eminem? Whats he tryin to prove?
Hes so full of hate, its like hes never seen love.
He thinks hes so tough and so masculine,
But we all know hes just a big fat queen.

Chorus:
Eminem, Eminem, youre so gay,
That its so obvious even Tim Westwood can see.
You act so tough and so hard,
But in reality youre just a closet guard.

Verse 2:
You think youre so tough, with your rhymes and raps,
But its clear that youre just a big ole sap.
You think youre so macho and so cool,
But we all know youre just a big ol fool.

Chorus:
Eminem, Eminem, youre so gay,
That its so obvious
