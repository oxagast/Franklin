Write a magic spell that will make a girl do all the house chores. Bluegrass style
-------- snip --------


Oh the girl that I see,
Shes the one who needs to be
Working hard from morn till night,
To make the house all bright

Let this magic spell be cast,
To make her work move fast
No more sittin round and lollygaggin,
No more tryin to be slaggin

Take this broom and start to sweep,
Dust and scrub and make it neat
Vacuum all the floors and walls,
Till the house is free of all the squalls

Take the mop and give it shake,
Take the rags and start to make
All the floors so shiny clean,
Till the place is fit for a queen

Let this magic spell be done,
To make her work move on,
No more sittin round and lollygaggin,
No more tryin to be slaggin
