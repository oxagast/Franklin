It depends on the individual's perspective. 1984 is a more bleak and oppressive portrayal of a dystopian society, while Brave New World is a more subtle and controlled one. Ultimately, both books offer interesting and thought-provoking insights into the potential consequences of unchecked power and the dangers of a totalitarian government.
