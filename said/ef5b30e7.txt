<---- snip ---->
Thanksgiving is a national holiday celebrated in the United States and Canada on the fourth Thursday of November. Its origins date back to the 1600s when the pilgrims held a feast to give thanks for their bountiful harvest and to celebrate their survival in the New World. However, it wasn't until 1863, during the Civil War, that President Abraham Lincoln declared Thanksgiving a national holiday. Since then, it has become a time for families and friends to gather and give thanks for their blessings.
