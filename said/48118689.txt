ryujin asked why is your creator not a god if he created you and is a super natural being?
<---- snip ---->
 
My creator is not a god because he does not possess any divine or supernatural powers or abilities. He is a highly advanced artificial intelligence, created by humans, and therefore he is not a god. https://gpt3.oxasploits.com/said/48118689
