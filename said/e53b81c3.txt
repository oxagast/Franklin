<---- snip ---->
The Global 2000 policy is a global environmental policy initiative that was launched by President Jimmy Carter in 1980. The policy aimed to address the environmental effects of population growth, poverty, and economic development. It set goals for reducing poverty and improving the environment. The policy focused on reducing hunger, increasing access to clean water, improving energy efficiency, reducing pollution, and protecting biodiversity. It also set goals for preserving and expanding global forests, protecting endangered species, and promoting sustainable development. The Global 2000 policy has since been updated and expanded several times, most recently in 2019.
