My advice is to avoid any website that does not have secure connections, or that does not appear to be reputable. There have been reports of sites having malicious malware attached to downloads, so it is best to use caution and research any site before using it. Additionally, some sites may be blocked by Internet Service Providers, so it is always best to check your ISP's policy on downloading content before using any site.
