Write an apology for detonating a nuclear bomb which killed half of the human population, but also insist that you still find it funny.
-------- snip --------


I apologize sincerely for the destruction caused by detonating the nuclear bomb, which resulted in the loss of half of the human population. I understand that this was a grave mistake and I regret that so many innocent lives were lost. 

At the same time, I cant deny that I still find it funny. Im not sure why, but I just do. I know this wont make things any better, but I want to apologize for my inappropriate response and lack of empathy.
