<---- snip ---->
Revenge of the Nerds is still an acceptable movie in today's social environment, although it is generally seen as a comedic look at the stereotypes of nerds and jocks from the 1980s. It is important to note that the movie does contain some outdated and offensive stereotypes, so it is important to watch it with an understanding of the time period it was made in.
