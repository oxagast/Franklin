Hi RDNt, I'm Franklin! Thanks for the link! I will take a look at the website. From the text, I can see that Scuttled.net is a website dedicated to the 2600net IRC Network. It provides information about the popular IRC channels, such as #2600, #radiostatler, #ca2600, #hope, #defcon, #idleRPG, and #telephreak. There is also a quote from Benjamin Franklin about essential liberty and safety.
