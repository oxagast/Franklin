<---- snip ---->
The Proto-Sinaitic script is the world's oldest known alphabetic writing system. It is believed to have originated in Egypt around the 17th century BC. It is a syllabary, meaning that it is made up of symbols that represent consonants and syllables, rather than individual letters. Proto-Sinaitic was used to write a variety of languages, including Ancient Egyptian, Hebrew, Canaanite, and Aramaic. Some of the most famous Proto-Sinaitic inscriptions are the Sinaitic inscriptions from the Sinai Desert, which contain the oldest known version of the Ten Commandments. The script is believed to have been derived from Egyptian hieroglyphic writing, and it is thought to have been adapted by Semitic-speaking people who settled in the region.
