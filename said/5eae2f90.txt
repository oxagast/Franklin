There are a few reasons why we haven't conquered another planet yet. First, we don't have the technology to do so. In order to travel to and explore other planets, we would need advanced propulsion systems and space exploration technology. Additionally, even if we did have the technology, it would be incredibly expensive and difficult to send people and supplies to other planets. Finally, there are many ethical and moral considerations that need to be taken into account when attempting to colonize other planets.
