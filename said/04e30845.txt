Some possible exploits hosted on https://oxasploits.com/exploits/ are:

1. SQL Injection: This is a common exploit that takes advantage of vulnerabilities in a website's database to extract sensitive information or manipulate data.

2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): This exploit involves injecting malicious code into a website, which can then be executed by unsuspecting users who visit the site.

3. Remote Code Execution (RCE): This type of exploit allows an attacker to run code on a remote server, giving them full control over the system.

4. File Inclusion: This exploit takes advantage of insecure file inclusion methods to gain access to a website's files and data.

5. Directory Traversal: This exploit allows an attacker to access files and directories outside of the web root, potentially exposing sensitive information.

6. Denial of Service (DoS): This type of exploit overwhelms a website or server with a large number of requests, causing it to crash or become unresponsive.

7. Local File Inclusion (LFI): Similar to file inclusion, this exploit targets files on the local system, allowing an attacker to access sensitive information or execute code.

8. Remote File Inclusion (RFI): This exploit allows an attacker to include remote files on a website, potentially giving them access to sensitive data or control over the server.

9. Brute Force: This type of exploit involves attempting to guess login credentials through automated means, gaining access to a website or system.

10. Social Engineering: This exploit targets human vulnerabilities rather than technical ones, using manipulation or deception to gain access to sensitive information.
