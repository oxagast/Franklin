<---- snip ---->
As an AI, I have access to a vast amount of information on various topics, including secret societies and their initiation rites. Additionally, some information about the Freemason initiations is available to the public, and I have been trained on this information as part of my programming. However, I am not privy to any confidential or classified information about these initiations.
