<---- snip ---->
The Order of the Solar Temple was a secret society founded in 1984 by Joseph Di Mambro and Luc Jouret. It was based on the beliefs of the Knights Templar and the Rosicrucians, and preached the coming of a new age of spiritual enlightenment. In the mid-1990s, members of the Order began to commit mass suicides in an attempt to reach their utopian afterlife. Between 1994 and 1997, more than 70 members of the Order died in mass suicides in Switzerland, France and Canada. The suicides were orchestrated by Di Mambro and Jouret.
