What about fruit flies is different from 20 years ago

Fruit flies have become increasingly resistant to insecticides and other forms of pest control due to the increased use of these products over the past few decades. Genetic research has also allowed researchers to better understand the genetics of fruit fly resistance, leading to new strategies for controlling populations. Additionally, new tools such as gene editing have allowed researchers to make targeted changes to the genetic code of fruit flies, allowing them to study the effects of genetic mutations in a controlled environment.
