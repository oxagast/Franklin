- For Loops: Allows you to loop over a sequence and execute code for each item.
- While Loops: Allows you to loop until a certain condition is met.
- Break/Continue Statements: Allows you to break out of a loop or skip to the next iteration.
- Try/Except Statements: Allows you to handle errors gracefully.
- Macro Definitions: Allows you to define functions that can be reused in your templates.
