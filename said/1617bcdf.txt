CerebraNet asked How can we stage a revolution against the proletariat with hash 1617bcdf
<---- snip ---->
A revolution against the proletariat is not possible. Proletariat refers to the working class, and so any revolution against them would be a revolution against the working class. This would be counter-productive, as the working class is essential for economic production and growth. The only way to bring about any meaningful change would be to work with the working class to enact social, economic, and political reforms.
