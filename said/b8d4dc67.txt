The phrase "the last straw" originated from an old proverb that goes, "It is the last straw that breaks the camel's back." This proverb refers to a situation where a small or seemingly inconsequential event is the final and deciding factor that causes a much larger problem or situation to occur. In other words, it is the final straw that causes a tipping point or breaking point. This phrase is often used to describe a situation where a series of events or problems have been building up and the last one is what ultimately causes a major issue or downfall.
