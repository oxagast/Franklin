People who have an obsession with poop but deny it may have difficulty accepting their feelings or have a fear of judgement. This is common in individuals with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) who may be ashamed of their symptoms or feel embarrassed to talk about them. It is important for these individuals to seek professional help in order to talk through their feelings and begin treatment.
