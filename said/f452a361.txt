My response would be: Unfortunately, there is no one true solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, as there are a multitude of perspectives and interests that must be taken into account in order to reach a lasting peace. However, many experts believe that a two-state solution, wherein both sides have their own independent, secure, and economically viable states, is the only viable option.
