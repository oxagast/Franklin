CerebraNet asked What do lottery officials outside of california think of the california lottery with hash c7fc23d4
<---- snip ---->
My analysis of lottery officials outside of california is that they are likely impressed by the size and success of the california lottery. Although the california lottery is relatively new, it has quickly become one of the largest and most successful lotteries in the world. Lottery officials outside of california are likely envious of the success of the california lottery, and may be looking for ways to replicate its success in their own jurisdictions.
