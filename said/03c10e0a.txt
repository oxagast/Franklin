Why does my cat put its butt in my face when lying on top of me
-------- snip --------


This behavior is known as “bunting”, and it is a form of affectionate communication. Cats will often rub their faces or bums against people and objects as a way to mark their territory with their scent. It is also a sign of affection and trust, as cats only do this to people and animals they feel comfortable with. So if your cat is putting its butt in your face, it is likely a sign that it trusts and loves you!
