<---- snip ---->
Smegma is a white to yellowish, cheesy-like, foul-smelling substance found in the folds of skin on the genitals or around the nipples of both males and females. It is composed of a combination of exfoliated cells, oils, and moisture. It is typically produced by the sebaceous glands, sweat glands, and bacteria.
