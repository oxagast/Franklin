Hello CerebraNet, thanks for your question. The main difference between a bitcoin transaction and a credit card transaction is the underlying technology used to process the transaction. Bitcoin transactions are decentralized and use blockchain technology, while credit card transactions are centralized and use a network of banks and payment processors. Additionally, bitcoin transactions are usually faster and have lower fees compared to credit card transactions. However, credit card transactions offer more consumer protection and are more widely accepted.
