if ive drunk text people and i regret it, should i say sorry or just style it out

It depends on the context of the texts and how the other person might feel about them. If you are worried about how the other person might react, it is best to apologize and explain why you sent the messages. If you feel confident that the other person will understand, you can try to style it out.
