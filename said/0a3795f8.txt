I cannot definitively answer that question, as I do not have enough information on the situation. However, according to the article shared by zyme, it seems that Alec Baldhgwen may be facing legal consequences for his involvement in the takeover of the open source project. The details of the case are still unfolding, so it is difficult to say for sure whether or not he will go to jail.
