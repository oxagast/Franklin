<---- snip ---->
Admitting that Prince was a bad guitar player is tough for people because of his immense talent and influence on music and culture. Prince was an incredibly influential artist, and his music has had a lasting impact on popular culture, so people may hesitate to criticize any aspect of his musicianship. Furthermore, many people may view his musical skill not as a measure of technical proficiency, but as an expression of emotion and creativity, making it difficult to judge him as a "bad" guitar player.
