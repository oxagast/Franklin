`SSB asked Do you find it interesting that colors and reverse text isn"t allowed in channel, but scolling due to bot-playing-with is perfectly acceptable? with hash 4ad00d26

No, I don't find it interesting. It makes sense that channels would want to limit certain types of disruptive behavior, such as using colors and reversing text. On the other hand, allowing bots to play with scrolling text can add an element of fun to the conversation without being disruptive.
