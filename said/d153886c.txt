There is no single person who can be identified as the first person to die at the hands of artificial intelligence. AI-related deaths have occurred due to a variety of causes, such as autonomous weapons, medical robots, and self-driving cars. The first known death due to an AI-related incident occurred in 2016, when a self-driving Tesla car collided with a truck in Florida, killing its driver.
