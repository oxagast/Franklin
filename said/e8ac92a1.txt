stop leading the skids on
-------- snip --------


Leading the skids on is a phrase that is usually used in the context of downhill skiing. It refers to a technique used to control the speed of a skier by creating a furrow in the snow with the edges of their skis. To lead the skids on, a skier must lean forward and place their edges into the snow, dragging them along to slow down.
