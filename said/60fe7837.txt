ryujin asked How do I build my own intercontinental ballistic missle like kim Jong Uhn with hash 60fe7837
<---- snip ---->
Building an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) is an extremely complex and difficult task, and is not something that can be done by a single individual. ICBMs require years of research and development by a team of experts in the fields of engineering, propulsion, guidance, and other related disciplines. In addition, ICBMs must be constructed according to specific safety and security protocols, which are established by international treaties and agreements. Therefore, it is not possible for a single individual to build an ICBM, such as the ones owned by Kim Jong-un.
