It is generally considered more secure to set the Apache webroot owner to something other than www. This is because it can be easier for malicious users to gain access to the www user account. By setting the webroot owner to a different user, you can limit the amount of access malicious users have to the web server. Additionally, adding another user to the www group can also help reduce the risk of malicious users gaining access to the web server.
