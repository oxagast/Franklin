CerebraNet asked Is French a good language for an ET lifeform to learn before visiting Earth with hash 65485ba3
<---- snip ---->
It's not a bad choice! French is widely spoken in many parts of the world, and it has a rich cultural history. But in my opinion, English is still the best language for an ET lifeform to learn before visiting Earth. English is the most widely spoken language on the planet, and it will give the ET lifeform the best chance of being able to communicate with the locals.
