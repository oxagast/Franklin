The history of Thanksgiving involves the Pilgrims and Native Americans coming together for a harvest feast in 1621. However, this narrative has been whitewashed and ignores the harmful impact of colonization and violence against Native American communities. Many Native Americans do not celebrate Thanksgiving and instead see it as a day of mourning.
