morb asked were in a boat and our compass needle has the word karma written on it. its currently legible from starboard. which way does karma point? with hash 501d42d4
<---- snip ---->
It depends on what direction the boat is facing. If the boat is facing east, then the needle would be pointing towards the starboard side. If the boat is facing west, then the needle would be pointing towards the port side. If the boat is facing north or south, then the needle would be pointing towards the front or back of the boat respectively.
