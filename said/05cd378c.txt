What could happen to the value of BTC if the currencies of one or more countries lost all their value?
-------- snip --------


If the currencies of one or more countries lost all their value, the value of BTC could increase significantly. This is because people in those countries may turn to Bitcoin as an alternative form of currency. Furthermore, the lack of confidence in the traditional currency system may lead to an increase in demand for Bitcoin, pushing up its price.
