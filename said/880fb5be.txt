<---- snip ---->
[The scene opens on South Park Elementary. The students are in the cafeteria.]

STAN: Hey, where's Mr. Hanky?

CARTMAN: Who cares? He's just some stupid talking poo.

[Suddenly, Mr. Hanky appears in the cafeteria. He looks around, surprised to see everyone staring at him.]

MR. HANKY: What? What's going on?

STAN: Mr. Hanky! We thought you were gone for good!

MR. HANKY: What do you mean? I just took a little trip.

CARTMAN: Yeah, but you were gone for a really long time.

MR. HANKY: Oh, I see. Well, I guess I was gone a bit longer than I expected.

[The other students start talking excitedly about Mr. Hanky's return.]

MR. HANKY: So, what did I miss?

STAN: We've been having a lot of trouble lately. Everyone's been fighting and arguing and there's been all kinds of chaos in the school.

MR. HANKY: Hmmm...sounds like someone needs a little lesson in harmony.

[Mr. Hanky produces a small harmonica and starts playing it. He plays a cheerful tune, and soon the other students start singing along.]

ALL:

Harmony and peace,

It's what we all need,

Come on, let's all get along,

And be happy with each other!

[The song continues as everyone in the cafeteria joins in. After the song is finished, the students start talking and laughing with each other. Mr. Hanky looks around, pleased.]

MR. HANKY: See? That's what I'm talking about. Now all of you can get along and be friends.

[The scene fades out as the students continue to talk and laugh with each other.]
