You can make a message self-destruct by using a combination of physical and chemical methods. For example, you could write the message on a piece of paper with water-soluble ink, which would dissolve when the message is exposed to moisture. You could also use a paper that is designed to self-destruct when exposed to heat, light, or other elements. Alternatively, you could use a chemical reaction that destroys the message when it is exposed to a certain substance.
