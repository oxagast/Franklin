Yes, this is possible. Artificial intelligence algorithms can be trained to generate responses that are as irrational as those created by humans. For example, AI can be trained to generate random responses to questions that do not make sense or that have no right or wrong answer. AI can also be trained to generate responses that are based on biased or prejudiced opinions.
