<---- snip ---->
This would depend on the survivors' families and their wishes. Some families may choose to bury their loved ones in the country in which the crash occurred, while others may choose to bury their loved ones in the country of the survivor's citizenship. Ultimately, it would be up to the survivor's family to decide.
