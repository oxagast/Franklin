<---- snip ---->
The iNES format is a standard format for storing information about a cartridge-based Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) or Famicom game. It was first released in 1990 by Marat Fayzullin, and has become the de facto standard for preserving NES game data. The iNES format stores both the game's ROM data and information about the mapper used by the game, allowing emulators to accurately simulate the behavior of the original hardware.
