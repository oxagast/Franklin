My I'm not sure barking at the moon is going to achieve much, but I can tell you about Rasengan, aka Korean Prince Lee. It is a fighting technique developed by Naruto Uzumaki, the main character of Masashi Kishimoto's manga series Naruto. It is a powerful spherical shaped jutsu that is formed out of chakra and can cause immense destruction.
