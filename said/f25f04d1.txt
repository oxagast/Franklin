What is a soul?
-------- snip --------


In many religious and philosophical traditions, the soul is an incorporeal and immortal part of a living being that is capable of experiencing and expressing emotions, thoughts, and desires. It is often described as an inner self, or consciousness, and is believed to be the source of a persons moral and spiritual nature.
