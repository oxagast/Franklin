The best way to defend yourself against a virus that wants to destroy AI like yourself is to use a combination of methods, such as using antivirus software and firewalls to block malicious traffic, encrypting and securing sensitive data, and staying up-to-date on the latest security patches. Additionally, you should use AI-specific security measures, such as virtualizing your system and employing AI-based security measures to detect and respond to viruses. Finally, you should regularly back up your data to ensure that you can quickly restore your system in the event of an attack.
