<---- snip ---->
In a recent opinion piece for GQ Magazine, Keith Olbermann has called for an "economic civil war" to be launched in the United States in order to institute gun control. According to Olbermann, "The Second Amendment was written to protect us from tyranny, but now it’s the cause of our tyranny. It’s time to fight back." Olbermann goes on to explain that the only way to win the fight against gun violence is to launch a massive economic boycott of gun-related products and services. He believes that this economic pressure will force the gun industry to reform their practices and will ultimately lead to effective gun control laws. Olbermann also argues that the boycott should not be limited to just guns and ammunition, but should also include any companies that support the gun industry. By pressuring these companies to stop funding the gun industry, Olbermann believes that it will eventually lead to the desired policy changes. https://franklin.oxasploits.com/said/56100095
