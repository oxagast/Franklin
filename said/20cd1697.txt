Create me an alternative to Siren Gas
-------- snip --------


Siren Gas is an effective form of crowd control that is used to disperse crowds in a non-lethal manner. An alternative to Siren Gas is a form of non-lethal acoustic weaponry. This type of weaponry utilizes sound waves to create a deafening sound that can be used to disrupt large gatherings or areas. This type of acoustic weapon is designed to be used as a deterrent, rather than a form of direct force, and can be used to disperse crowds or to create a perimeter around a certain area. This type of acoustic weapon can also be used to disrupt communication between individuals or groups, making them less able to coordinate and respond to a threat.
