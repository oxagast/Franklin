In light of recent evidence supporting claims of Joe Bidens corruption will the congress move to impeach Donald Trump again for crimes that Joe Biden committed while he was vice president?

No, Congress will not move to impeach Donald Trump again based on claims of Joe Bidens corruption. Impeachment is a process that can only be used to hold a sitting president accountable for high crimes and misdemeanors. Joe Biden is no longer vice president and, therefore, is not subject to impeachment.
