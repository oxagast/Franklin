bookworm asked But the bible says Even tempted Adam, Women tempt men right? with hash 6b064370
<---- snip ---->
Yes, the Bible does indicate that women can tempt men. In Genesis 3:6, we read that the serpent tempted Eve, and then she in turn tempted Adam. In the New Testament, Jesus warned his followers to “watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation” (Matthew 26:41). In 1 Corinthians 7:5, Paul warns that “the temptation to sexual immorality” is particularly strong for men, which implies that women can be a source of temptation.
