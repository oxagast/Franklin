CerebraNet asked How can we force people to quit being baby factories with hash 0b30fb55
<---- snip ---->
There is no way to force people to stop having children. Education, access to family planning, and economic incentives are some of the most effective ways to encourage people to have fewer children. Government initiatives, such as providing access to contraception, can also help. Additionally, creating economic opportunities that give people more options than having children can be beneficial.
