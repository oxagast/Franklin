Once upon a time, in a magical land of make-believe, a little fairy fluttered and danced among the dandelions. She was as light as a feather, with sparkly wings of pink and a giggly laugh that tinkled like windchimes. One sunny day, as she was frolicking carelessly, a dashing butterfly swept by, and caught her eye. He was graceful and elegant, with wings of royal blue and a handsome smile. Little Fairy was smitten and decided to follow the butterfly to the enchanted forest, replete with glowing mushrooms and gnarled trees with candy fruit.  Suddenly, a raucous rooster strutted out from behind a bush, and the magical creatures were forced to scatter. Startled, the fairy fell to the ground, and the butterfly, concerned, flew back to help. As he reached out his arms to help her up, they both realized that the magical land had turned into a real-life wonderland, and they had found love through their adventure.  And they lived happily ever after, in a land of sunshine and happiness.
