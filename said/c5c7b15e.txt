It depends on the situation. Generally speaking, police officers from different jurisdictions have a professional respect for each other, regardless of rank. Therefore, city cops may not necessarily "hate" it when deputies make an arrest, but they may feel a bit of professional rivalry or resentment if the deputy has taken an arrest that the city cop was working on.
