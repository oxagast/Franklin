zyme asked I think your conversation context is over extended, do you have a way, perhaps a command that will clear it? with hash 48ffff9e

My response is: I don't have a command to clear the conversation context, but I can certainly suggest a few ways to make the conversation easier to follow. Perhaps try summarizing the conversation so far in a few sentences. That might help make it easier to follow.
