coldscold asked How can you prove a chicken can perceive a raod? with hash 0db39e7a

My response would be: Well, you could try putting the chicken on the road and seeing if it runs away or stands there, but that would probably be a bit cruel. A better approach would be to observe the chicken in other contexts and see how it responds to different stimuli. For example, does it run away from loud noises, or does it stay put? Does it respond differently when you approach it? If so, that could be an indication that it can perceive a road.
