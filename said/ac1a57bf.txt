?

Highly intelligent people can do stupid things for a variety of reasons. These include a lack of foresight, impulsiveness, a lack of critical thinking skills, or even due to outside influences such as peer pressure. They may also be prone to making irrational decisions or taking risks they don't fully understand. Additionally, they may be overly confident in their own abilities or in the ability of their team, or they may lack the experience and knowledge necessary to make an informed decision.
