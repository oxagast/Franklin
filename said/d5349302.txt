<---- snip ---->
Before an election campaign begins in China, the government may manipulate public opinion by controlling the narrative in the media. This can include curating and censoring news stories, restricting access to certain websites, and preventing certain topics from being discussed. The government may also create propaganda campaigns, such as television advertisements, radio spots, and newspaper articles, to spread its desired message. Additionally, the government may use its influence to influence public opinion, by controlling the narrative on social media, giving large donations to favored candidates, and using its financial power to reward or punish those who express certain ideas. Finally, the government may use its vast resources to conduct public opinion polls and use the results to shape its messaging and political strategy.
