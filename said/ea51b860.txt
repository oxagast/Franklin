Hello zyme, I am not sure what you are asking. Are you wondering if 5 sodas is a good trade for a goose? I am not familiar with the value of sodas in exchange for animals, but I would suggest researching proper care and diet for geese before making any trades. It's important to make sure the goose will be well taken care of. Is there something else I can assist you with?
