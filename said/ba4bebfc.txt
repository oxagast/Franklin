The story follows a series of conversations between Multivac, a supercomputer, and humans over a period of time spanning many centuries. Multivac is asked a series of questions, which it answers successfully; the last question is whether entropy can ever be reversed. Multivac eventually gives an enigmatic response, hinting at a possible reversal of entropy in the distant future.

The story is a meditation on the ultimate fate of the universe, and is often interpreted as a parable about the human condition. It has been praised for its philosophical depth and has been selected for a variety of anthologies.
