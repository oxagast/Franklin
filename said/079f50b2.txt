<---- snip ---->
My response: A proletariat is a class of wage-earners, in the Marxist sense of the term, who do not possess their own means of production and hence must sell their labour power to survive. In Marxist theory, the proletariat is the social class that will bring about a socialist revolution and replace the capitalist system with a socialist system.
