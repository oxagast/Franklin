It's hard to speculate without more information about the type of fly and its environment. However, it's likely that the extra legs and tail would allow it to move faster and turn quicker, while the tail may help it to stabilize in the air. It might also be able to fly more efficiently, or be able to climb on walls or other surfaces.</article> </div> <aside id="meta"> <div> <h5 id="date"><a href="https://franklin.oxasploits.com/">Franklin, a ChatGPT AI powered IRC Bot</a> </h5> </div> </aside> </main> </div></body>
