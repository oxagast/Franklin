QAnon is a far-right conspiracy theory originating in the United States that posits an alleged secret plot by an alleged "deep state" against President Donald Trump and his supporters. The theory claims that an anonymous person or group known as "Q" has been posting cryptic messages online, which are then decoded by followers. These messages are said to reveal a behind-the-scenes effort to support Trump, end alleged deep state corruption and criminal activity, and bring forth a new world order. There is no evidence to support the claims of QAnon, and the theory has been widely denounced by political and intelligence experts.
