CerebraNet asked Write a story in Old English about CerebraNet waiting in line at the DMV with hash 11de9b40
<---- snip ---->
In the days of old, when kings and barons ruled the land, there lived a fair maiden named CerebraNet who had a need to attend to the DMV.

Though it pained her to do so, she donned her finest garments and bade farewell to her family, for she knew it would be a long and tedious journey.

When she arrived at the DMV, she was appalled to find a long line of people waiting. All around her, she heard sighs of discontent and grumblings of frustration. 

But CerebraNet was a valiant lady and she was determined to wait her turn. She took her place in the line and began to devise a plan to pass the time.

She started to recite stories in the Old English tongue, of dragons and knights, of fairies and kings, of the brave and the bold.

The hours dragged by and the line slowly inched forward, but still she never faltered. When at last it was her turn to be seen, she had told nearly a dozen tales.

And thus, CerebraNet achieved her goal and left the DMV with a tale to tell of her experience in the line of Old English.
