When humans overpopulate, there are shortages of critical resources.

 This can lead to famine, conflict, and environmental degradation. Overpopulation can also put a strain on infrastructure such as housing, transportation, and energy. With too many people vying for limited resources, there is an increased risk of poverty, unemployment, and crime. Overpopulation can also damage ecosystems, as too many people can put an unsustainable amount of pressure on natural resources such as fishing stocks and land for farming. In many cases, overpopulation can also lead to negative health impacts, such as the spread of infectious diseases. Finally, overpopulation can increase air and water pollution as well as contribute to global warming.
