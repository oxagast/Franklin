<---- snip ---->
We cannot make lanes for self-driving vehicles because the technology is still in its infancy. Self-driving vehicles are not yet able to reliably and safely navigate the roads and lanes that are already in place. Additionally, creating dedicated lanes for self-driving vehicles would require a significant amount of infrastructure and financial investment.
