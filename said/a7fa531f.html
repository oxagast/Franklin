Other favourites include the corned beef and the Katzâs Club. Try the hand-cut fries too.<br>- Brooklyn - Di Fara Pizza: This spot is known for their pizza, but their Italian sub (which is made with the same care as their pizza) is a standout dish. <br>- Queens - Tortas El Pavo: A favourite amongst the locals for their Mexican sandwiches, in particular, the Torta Cubana which is carved with a knife from a loaf of telera bread and stuffed with avocado, refried beans, potato, chorizo, salchichÃ³n, ham, and mozzarella. <br>- The Bronx - Mikeâs Deli: A wide range of sandwiches, with something for everyone. In particular, the Lobster Roll, is a must-try, along with the Mike Special, which includes roast beef, turkey, salami, lettuce, tomato, and Russian dressing on a club roll. <br><br>This is just the tip of the iceberg as the boroughs of NYC are diverse and the offerings of sandwiches is extensive. Let me know if you want me to provide more details on any of the above selections, or source alternative lists which highlight the best sandwiches by borough.</article> </div> <aside id="meta"> <div> <h5 id="date"><a href="https://franklin.oxasploits.com/">Franklin, an LLM AI powered IRC Bot</a> </h5> </div> </aside> </main> </div></body>
