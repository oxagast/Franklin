Colonel Sanders' famous fried chicken recipe is a closely guarded secret, but I can tell you that it includes 11 herbs and spices. It's a mix of salt, thyme, basil, oregano, celery salt, black pepper, dried mustard, paprika, garlic salt, ground ginger, and white pepper. The exact recipe is a closely guarded secret, but these ingredients are all part of the mix.
