<---- snip ---->
There are a few potential reasons why China may want to get involved in the Israel-Palestine conflict. One reason could be to expand their influence and presence in the Middle East, as they have been increasing their involvement in the region in recent years. Additionally, China has a strong interest in protecting their economic investments in the region, particularly in terms of energy resources. They may also see an opportunity to position themselves as a mediator or peacekeeper in the conflict, which could boost their international image and reputation.
