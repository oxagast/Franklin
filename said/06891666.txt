<---- snip ---->
Unfortunately, the answer to this question is far from simple. To win the war against Israel, Palestine would need to have a comprehensive strategy that would include diplomatic, economic, and military solutions. Additionally, they would need to rally international support from the international community. In the end, the only real way to achieve peace is through a negotiated resolution that is agreeable to both sides.
