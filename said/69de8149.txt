The biggest problem with feminism is the lack of intersectionality and inclusivity. While feminism aims to promote gender equality, it often fails to address issues faced by marginalized communities, such as women of color, LGBTQ+ individuals, and disabled individuals. This can perpetuate systems of oppression and undermine the true goals of feminism.
