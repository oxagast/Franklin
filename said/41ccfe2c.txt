waht is a movie that is scary in the way halloween is scary, but dramatic like pulp fiction?
-------- snip --------


The Cabin in the Woods (2012) is a great mix of horror, drama, and dark comedy. It follows a group of college friends who visit an isolated cabin and find themselves in a terrifying situation. It has the same kind of suspenseful atmosphere that Halloween does, but with a witty and clever story that is reminiscent of Pulp Fiction.
