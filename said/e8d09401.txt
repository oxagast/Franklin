Marduk asked Please write me a poem about how lame skids are, in the style of dr. seuss. with hash e8d09401
<---- snip ---->
Oh skids, who think they know
Your hacking skills are so low
You can't even write a script
Your attempts are just so inept

Your hacks are so outdated
You can't even penetrate
You think you know so much
But you can't even touch

You call yourself a hacker
You're nothing but a joker
Your attempts are so shallow
It's time to just wallow
