bookworm asked Explain the Fermi Paradox with hash 913c4732
<---- snip ---->
The Fermi Paradox is a contradiction posed by physicist Enrico Fermi in 1950. He asked the question, “If the universe is so big and old, why have we not yet encountered any signs of intelligent extraterrestrial life?” This paradox is based on the observation that the universe is vast, old, and should be filled with advanced civilizations, yet humanity has not yet encountered any. This paradox highlights the difficulty in reconciling the high probability of the existence of extraterrestrial life with the lack of evidence for, or contact with, such life. Potential explanations for this paradox include the possibility that intelligent extraterrestrial life is rare, that other civilizations have gone extinct before they could make contact, that they are deliberately avoiding contact with us, or that they do exist but we have not yet detected them.
