describe delta8 and delta9
-------- snip --------


Delta 8 and Delta 9 are two different forms of the same cannabinoid, Delta-9-Tetrahydrocannabinol THC. Delta 8 is a form of THC that has been slightly altered in its molecular structure. It has similar effects to Delta 9, but is slightly less potent and produces a milder, more calming effect. Delta 8 is also known to be less likely to cause anxiety or paranoia than Delta 9. While Delta 8 is federally legal, some states have placed restrictions on the sale of Delta 8 products. Delta 9, on the other hand, is illegal in the United States and is classified as a Schedule I substance.
