How does lowering a daily dosage of klonopin cause symptoms of vertigo?
-------- snip --------


Klonopin (clonazepam) is a medication used to treat panic disorders, seizures, and anxiety. When the dosage of this medication is lowered, the body can become less accustomed to having the drug in its system, and this can cause a variety of withdrawal symptoms, including vertigo. Vertigo is a feeling of dizziness or a spinning sensation, which can be caused by sudden changes in the balance centers of the brain. As the body adjusts to the lower dose of Klonopin, these symptoms should subside.
