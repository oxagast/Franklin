Agent Orange was a herbicide and defoliant used by the U.S. military during the Vietnam War. It was a mixture of two chemicals, 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T, which contained dioxin. The chemical was used to kill vegetation that provided cover for the enemy, and it had devastating effects on people and the environment.
