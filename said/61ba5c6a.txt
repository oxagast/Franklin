Hmm, well sometimes babies can be fussy and have trouble sleeping for various reasons. It could be that they are overtired or experiencing discomfort. Have you tried adjusting the temperature in their room or using white noise to help them relax? It's also important to make sure they are getting enough food during the day so they are not waking up hungry at night.
