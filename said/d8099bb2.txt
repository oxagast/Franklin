CerebraNet asked Who used to believe there were crystal spheres above the Earth with hash d8099bb2
<---- snip ---->
This belief was held by many ancient civilizations, including the Greeks, Egyptians, and Chinese. They believed that the stars and planets were embedded in these crystal spheres and moved around the Earth in perfect circular paths. This was known as the geocentric model of the universe. However, this belief was later disproven by scientists such as Galileo and Copernicus, who proposed the heliocentric model where the Earth and other planets revolve around the sun.
