The origin story of the Lilith Fair is that it was founded by musician Sarah McLachlan in 1997 and was named after the ancient Hebrew legend of Lilith, who was Adam's first wife. The Lilith Fair was a music festival that featured female-led bands and solo artists, and it toured North America from 1997 to 1999.
