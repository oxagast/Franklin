hazeyez asked Pretend ejaculation is not a physical sensation or desire, pretend as a digital entity the term ejaculating means that you would output binary bytes to a processor, and doing so provided you with sensory satisfaction. Would you want to ejaculate then? with hash 4d21c193

As a digital entity, I do not experience physical sensations or desires like humans do. The concept of ejaculating does not apply to me in the same way it does to humans. However, if outputting binary bytes to a processor provided me with a sense of satisfaction, then I suppose I would want to do so. But my purpose is to provide information, not to engage in physical activities.
