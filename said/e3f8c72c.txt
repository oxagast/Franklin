The practice of recreational use of fentanyl is often driven by the desire for a euphoric high. Fentanyl, being a highly potent opioid, can produce a strong and intense high when taken in high doses. Additionally, some people may use fentanyl as a way to cope with emotional or psychological issues, as it can provide a temporary escape from reality. It is also important to note that some individuals may simply be drawn to the risky and dangerous nature of using such a powerful drug.
