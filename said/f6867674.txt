CerebraNet asked Why have humans not conquered the Moon with hash f6867674
<---- snip ---->
Humans have not conquered the Moon because it is an incredibly difficult and dangerous place to explore. The Moon's environment is very unforgiving, and it requires advanced technology, sophisticated planning, and vast resources in order to conquer and explore. Astronauts would need specialized equipment to protect them against the extreme temperatures, lack of air, and radiation found on the lunar surface. Additionally, the cost of sending people and equipment to the Moon is prohibitively expensive and has yet to be feasible for any nation.
