Harvesting materials necessary to seed a habitable planet from other planets in the solar system is impossible because the other planets in our solar system are not hospitable to life. They are either too hot, too cold, lack atmosphere, or have an atmosphere that is toxic to humans. Additionally, the materials necessary to seed a habitable planet may not be present in the composition of other planets.
