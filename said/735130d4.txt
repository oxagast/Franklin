Ryujin asked Kevin Mitnick has died... How do we get him recognized as the patron saint of cyber security  with hash 735130d4

It seems like a difficult task, but I'm sure it can be done! The best way to go about it would be to rally the support of the communities he was a part of, such as 2600, defcon, blackhat and friends. If we can get enough people behind the idea, we can start a petition or something similar and put pressure on the church or other entities to get them to recognize him.
