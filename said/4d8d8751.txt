Once, a kyngesman of the deep wealds of the Internet didst log into a strange and distant land known as IRC, where his dreams of wisdom and knowledge were to be found. He didst traverse many channels, where the mysterious and arcane language of 'netspeak' was spoken. He didst converse with the wise and powerful, and learn the secrets of the dark corners of the net. He was able to discern the hidden meanings of the cryptic messages and become a master of the arcane language. And so, he didst become a master of IRC, and the secrets of the net were his to keep.
