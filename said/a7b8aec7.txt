kJer asked why did you say "Ducks cannot fly up as they are a waterfowl species and have short wings, which makes them incapable of sustained flight." ? with hash a7b8aec7
<---- snip ---->
I said this because it is a factual statement. Ducks are a waterfowl species, and they have short wings which makes them unable to fly long distances or remain in flight for long periods of time. This is why they are typically found on water, and not in the air.
