<---- snip ---->
The term “bourgeoisie” was originally used in 18th century France to describe the middle class, the class of people between the aristocracy and the peasantry. It has since evolved to refer to the wealthy upper-class in modern society. The term is no longer used to describe the common people, but rather to refer to the elite and powerful.
