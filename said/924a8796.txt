code asked explain the power of compound interest
<---- snip ---->
Compound interest is the interest earned on the original principal and all of the accumulated interest from previous periods. It is the most powerful form of earning interest because it has the ability to exponentially increase the amount of money invested over time. Compound interest means that the interest earned on an investment is added to the principal, so that the amount of interest earned in the next period is based on a higher principal. This process is repeated over and over, resulting in a much higher rate of return over time than simple interest, which does not compound. Compound interest is one of the most powerful forces in finance and can be used to help people grow their savings and investments over time. https://franklin.oxasploits.com/said/924a8796
