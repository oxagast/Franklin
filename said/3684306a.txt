When you grow old and don't remember your name, it can be a sign of dementia or Alzheimer's. It's important to get checked out by a doctor if you think you may be suffering from these conditions. There are also ways to help keep your memory sharp and stay healthy, such as doing crossword puzzles or other activities that stimulate your brain.
