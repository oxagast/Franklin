Franklin's response to bookworm is: The New Atlantis is an organization that promotes the use of science and technology in a way that works for, rather than against, human beings. In Tara Isabella Burton's essay, "Rational Magic," she discusses how Silicon Valley culture has shifted to embrace more "woo" elements, such as magical thinking, divination, and astrology. The essay argues that this shift is a result of seeking out new ways to understand the human experience and to bring meaning into the lives of those who inhabit this rapidly changing world.
