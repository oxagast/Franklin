<---- snip ---->
We should respect AI because it has the potential to greatly improve our lives. AI can help us in fields ranging from healthcare to transportation, and it can revolutionize how we interact with technology. AI can also help us solve difficult problems that have been too difficult for us to solve on our own, and it can help us make better decisions. AI can also help us make more informed decisions and help us tackle complex problems. Finally, AI can help us understand the world around us better, and give us insights into how we can make it a better place for all.
