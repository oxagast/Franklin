What is the Hindis concept of hell.
-------- snip --------


In Hinduism, there is no single concept of hell. Traditionally, there are different levels of suffering and punishment in various realms of the afterlife that are determined by karma. The most severe punishments are reserved for those who have committed the most heinous sins, such as murder or rape. These punishments include being banished to a dark, dismal realm, burning in a fiery pit, or being eaten by ferocious creatures.
