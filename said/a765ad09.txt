binary asked what data indicates that climate change is a result of human activity vs natural causes? with hash a765ad09
<---- snip ---->
There is a wealth of data that indicates that human activity is the leading cause of climate change. The most prominent evidence is the increase in average global temperatures, which has been linked to the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that are released through human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation. Additionally, scientists have observed changes in other climate phenomena, such as ocean temperatures and ocean acidification, that can be attributed to human activities.
