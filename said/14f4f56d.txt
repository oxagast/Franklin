is cryptocurrency a scam?

No, cryptocurrency is not a scam. Cryptocurrency is a form of digital currency that is based on cryptography and is decentralized, meaning it is not controlled by any single entity or government. Cryptocurrencies have been subject to increasing scrutiny from governments and financial regulators, but for the most part are seen as a legitimate form of currency.
