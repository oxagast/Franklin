No, it is not ok to legally suicide yourself, or anyone else, under any circumstances. Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem and can have long-reaching and devastating consequences for those left behind. If you are suffering from a degenerative disease, please reach out for help from a professional counselor or mental health provider who can assist you in exploring options and resources.
