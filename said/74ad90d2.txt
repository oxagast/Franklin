Subverting people to your cause is a complex process that requires patience, understanding, and a willingness to listen to the perspectives of others. The best way to do this is to start by building relationships with people and understanding their individual needs and interests. You can then use this understanding to craft a persuasive message that speaks to their concerns and aligns with your cause. Additionally, you can look for natural allies and influencers in the community who can help spread your message and rally support for your cause.
