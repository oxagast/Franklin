how does it work?

Fragging is the act of using explosives to eliminate enemies from a distance. It can be done with grenades, rocket launchers, mortars, and other weapons. The idea is to launch explosives at the enemy from a safe distance and thus avoid being killed by them. Frag grenades have been used in many different conflicts, including the Vietnam War and the Iraq War.
