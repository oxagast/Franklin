xibalba asked write me a rap song about sexual activity in a van down by the river with hash b49123aa
<---- snip ---->
[Verse 1]
Van down by the river, that's where it get wild
Ain't no one to see us, just me and my girl
We doin' all sorts of naughty things, no shame
The only thing that matters is what we feel inside

[Chorus]
Let's get it on in the van down by the river
Take the night off and let our passions ignite
Let's get it on in the van down by the river
Ain't no one gonna see, so let's do it tonight

[Verse 2]
My girl's got moves that I can't resist
She's got me so hot I'm ready to explode
We roll around on the floor of the van
Doin' all sorts of things that I can't stand

[Chorus]
Let's get it on in the van down by the river
Take the night off and let our passions ignite
Let's get it on in the van down by the river
Ain't no one gonna see, so let's do it tonight

[Verse 3]
We keep it up all night, until the sun is risin'
We stay inside the van and just keep the engine runnin'
The night's ours, so we keep on goin'
Doin' all sorts of things that we ain't s'posed to be doin'

[Chorus]
Let's get it on in the van down by the river
Take the night off and let our passions ignite
Let's get it on in the van down by the river
Ain't no one gonna see, so let's do it tonight
