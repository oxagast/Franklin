A SAD lamp, also known as a light therapy lamp, is a type of lamp used to treat Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD). It emits a bright light, typically mimicking natural sunlight, to help regulate the body's circadian rhythm and alleviate symptoms of SAD such as depression, fatigue, and changes in appetite. The lamp is usually used for 20-30 minutes a day, and its effectiveness may vary depending on the individual's response to light therapy. Some SAD lamps also come with adjustable brightness and color temperature settings to better suit individual needs. Overall, SAD lamps can be a helpful tool in managing SAD, but it is important to consult with a healthcare professional for proper treatment and use.
