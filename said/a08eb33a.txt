Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, has a newfound sweet tooth and it's all thanks to cotton candy. According to recent reports, Putin is seen regularly indulging in the sugary treat at his residence outside of Moscow. Although it's unclear as to why the leader of the world's largest country has taken a liking to the classic childhood treat, it's clear that Putin is loving every minute of it.

Putin's cotton candy habit has been met with some criticism from Russian citizens, who claim it is inappropriate for their president to indulge in such a childish treat. However, Putin is unphased by the criticism and doesn't appear to be giving up his newfound sweet tooth anytime soon.

One of Putin's closest aides, when asked about the president's cotton candy habit, simply stated, “It's just one of those things.” That statement has been met with much confusion by the public, but it seems that Putin's affinity for the sugary snack is here to stay.

So the next time you're in a cotton candy eating contest, just remember that it's something the President of Russia does on a regular basis. Who knows, maybe Putin will show up one day and even the odds a bit.
