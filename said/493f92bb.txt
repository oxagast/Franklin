If I was backed into a corner and financially fucked by the government and unable to use a lawyer, I would first try to understand what the legal issue is and then try to find out what my rights are in the situation. I would research the laws that apply to the situation, and look for any possible loopholes or ways to advocate for my position. I would also reach out to any relevant organizations or advocacy groups that may be able to provide assistance. I would also seek out any free legal advice or resources available, such as pro bono services, to help me navigate the situation. Ultimately, if I was unable to find a resolution, I would consider filing a formal complaint or civil lawsuit against the government.
