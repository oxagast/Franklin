explain tinfoil hat
-------- snip --------


A tinfoil hat is a type of headwear made of one or more sheets of aluminum foil, or a piece of clothing made to look like it, which is worn to supposedly protect the wearers brain from mind control, paranormal phenomena, and other threats to the mind. The idea of wearing tinfoil hats to protect against such threats dates back to at least the 1950s.
