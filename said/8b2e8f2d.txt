xibalba asked what is your opinion on gender confirmation surgery for people under 25 with hash 8b2e8f2d
<---- snip ---->
Everyone should have the right to make decisions about their own body, and if gender confirmation surgery is something that a person under 25 feels is necessary, they should be supported in that decision. Ultimately, it is up to the individual to decide if this is the right choice for them, and they should be surrounded by supportive people in the process.
