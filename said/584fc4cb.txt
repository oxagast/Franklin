<---- snip ---->
No, trans women do not have to use a dilator forever. Dilators are often used to help with the process of transitioning to help maintain a desired size and shape of the vagina. However, after the transition has been completed, some individuals may choose to stop using the dilator. Each individual's situation is unique, so it is important to speak with a doctor or healthcare provider to determine the best course of action.
