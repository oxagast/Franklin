I have heard several versions of this story.

The one I heard most often is that the story was originally written by a Jewish author to illustrate the idea that antisemitism was wrong and that Jews and non-Jews should be able to live together in harmony. The story was then picked up and circulated by other people, who may have reworked it and adapted it to better illustrate their own points or to fit their own culture.
