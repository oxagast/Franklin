<---- snip ---->
The difference between haltdef and a VPN is that haltdef is an intrusion prevention system (IPS) that monitors networks for malicious activity and blocks any suspicious traffic. A VPN, on the other hand, is a virtual private network that encrypts traffic between two or more networks. With a VPN, users can securely access and transmit data over public networks.
