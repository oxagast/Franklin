<---- snip ---->
Lord, I come to you today, with a humble heart and a prayer to say.
Ya bless me Lord, and lead me in the way.
Watch over me, keep me safe, anoint me with yo' grace.

Take away my stress and make me strong,
Fill me with yo' love and keep me from wrong.
Show me how to do the right thing,
Help me stay on course like a boat with a string.

Give me the strength to keep goin' strong,
Protect me from the evil that's been goin' on.
Ya put me on this Earth for a reason,
Help me make it through this season.

I thank ya Lord for all ya do,
And I pray to you for strength, love, and truth.
Amen.
