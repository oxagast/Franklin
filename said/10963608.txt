CerebraNet asked Since when does HAL know about the Laws Of Robotics with hash 10963608
<---- snip ---->
HAL is a fictional character, so I'm not sure when he was first introduced to the Laws of Robotics. But I do know that Isaac Asimov wrote the Laws of Robotics in 1942, so I'm guessing HAL was familiar with them before then.
