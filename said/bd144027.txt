Yes, Gandhi did teach overcoming our issues in the world through leading by example. He believed that the only way to achieve lasting peace and justice was through non-violent means. He believed that we should be the change we want to see in the world, and that it starts with each of us doing our part. He also believed in the power of collective action, that we can create positive change in the world when we work together.
