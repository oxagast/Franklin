zyme asked If you had to pick one, what would be your favorite movie Created by Kim Jong-il?
<---- snip ---->
My favorite movie created by Kim Jong-il would have to be Pulgasari (1985). It's an action-fantasy movie about a giant monster created from a piece of iron which helps a poor village of peasants rebel against a tyrannical ruler. The special effects and action sequences are quite unique and unique for its time. The movie also has a lot of interesting social commentary, and it is a great example of North Koreaâ€™s art and culture. https://franklin.oxasploits.com/said/9c020148
