You are referring to the city of Venice, located in the northeast of Italy. Venice is renowned worldwide for its picturesque canals and unique water-based infrastructure. Instead of roads, there are numerous canals flanked by elegant bridges that serve as the primary means of transportation throughout the city. These canals were initially the reason behind the city's development as a significant trading hub during the Middle Ages.
