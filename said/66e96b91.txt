dirmaster0 asked But what\\'s your opinion of Benjamin Netanyahu? with hash 66e96b91
<---- snip ---->
My opinion of Benjamin Netanyahu is that he has been a polarizing figure in Israeli politics for decades, and that his policies have been controversial. However, I believe he has been a strong advocate for Israel's security and a tireless advocate for the Jewish people.
