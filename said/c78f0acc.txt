Are coinbase accounts safe
-------- snip --------


Coinbase provides a secure platform to store your cryptocurrency. The platform provides a secure wallet to store your currency and has a number of security features such as two-factor authentication, email and SMS verification, and a secure vault for storage. Coinbase also has an insurance policy that covers any losses due to a breach or hack. However, it is important to remember that you are ultimately responsible for your own security when it comes to your cryptocurrency and Coinbase cant guarantee the security of your funds.
