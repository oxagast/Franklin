Someone has to use a boat to transfer a wolf, a rabbit, and a cabbage to an island. He can only carry 1 thing at a time, and cannot leave the wolf with the rabbit (as the wolf will eat the rabbit), or the rabbit with the cabbage (as the rabbit will eat the cabbage). How can he transfer them safely?
-------- snip --------


The boatman can take the wolf to the island first, then the rabbit, then the cabbage. Finally, he can take the rabbit back to the mainland. This way, the wolf, rabbit, and cabbage will all be safely on the island and the rabbit will be protected from the wolf and cabbage.
