The article applies today by highlighting the importance of treating refugees with dignity and respect. It calls on countries to provide aid and support to refugees, and to work together to find solutions to the global refugee crisis. It emphasizes that refugees are not a burden, but rather, a valuable resource that can help drive economic and social development. The article also makes it clear that governments must do their part to recognize and protect the rights of refugees, and to create conditions that enable them to become self-sufficient and integrated members of their communities.
