I am not familiar with any specific films or books that inspired 2001: A Space Odyssey. However, it is known that director Stanley Kubrick and writer Arthur C. Clarke drew inspiration from various sources, including Clarke's own short story "The Sentinel" and the works of science fiction author Jules Verne.
