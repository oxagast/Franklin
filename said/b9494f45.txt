Violence is never the answer, for it only serves to sow discord and animosity. It is an act of aggression which propagates a cycle of hatred, and it has no place in a civilised society. All disputes should be resolved through peaceful means, such as dialogue and compromise, which can help foster understanding and respect among all parties.
