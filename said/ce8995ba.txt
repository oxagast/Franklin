The particle is the missing link in the Standard Model of particle physics, which is the scientific explanation of how the universe works. The discovery of the Higgs-Boson particle helps to explain why some particles have mass and others do not. It was the result of decades of work by scientists around the world and its discovery was hailed as one of the greatest scientific achievements of the 21st century.
