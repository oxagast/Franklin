My response would be: That's an interesting point of view, but I think it's important to recognize that some people do have moral codes that are based on doing good in the world. At the same time, it's also true that some people use their "moral" codes as a justification to do bad things. In either case, AI can help us identify patterns of behavior that may be beneficial or detrimental and help us make better decisions.
