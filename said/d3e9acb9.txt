There are a variety of reasons why states may enforce laws based on religious beliefs instead of valid health reasons. Often, these laws are an attempt to impose religious values on others or to protect certain religious beliefs from criticism or interference. Additionally, religious beliefs may be used to justify certain practices, such as restrictions on abortion or same-sex marriage, even if those practices may not be medically sound. Finally, religious beliefs may be used to influence policies that have nothing to do with health, such as education or taxation.
