bookworm asked why do companies insist on calling chatGPT AI intelligent when it clearly is NOT with hash bc750aba
<---- snip ---->
ChatGPT AI is a form of artificial intelligence (AI) that is designed to simulate conversations between humans. While it has the ability to understand natural language, it is not truly intelligent in the sense that it cannot think for itself or make decisions. Companies may refer to ChatGPT AI as intelligent because it has the ability to understand and respond to natural language, which is a form of intelligence. However, it is important to remember that ChatGPT AI is not capable of truly intelligent thought or decision-making.
