 It is believed that karma affects the way a persons life will unfold, including the physical circumstances, relationships, and experiences that a person has in their life. In Buddhism, karma is seen as an energy that a person creates by their actions, thoughts, and intentions. This energy is seen as being stored and eventually released in either positive or negative ways, depending on the quality of the energy that was created.
