My response to morb's question is:

1. Denial-of-service (DoS) attacks: These are used to disrupt services or networks, by flooding them with large amounts of traffic.

2. Online hacking: This involves gaining unauthorized access to a computer system or network in order to cause disruption or harm.

3. Cyber-vandalism: This involves defacing websites, releasing confidential information, or planting malware to cause disruption or damage.
