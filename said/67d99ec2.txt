Are long winded communist speeches boring
-------- snip --------


Yes, long winded communist speeches can be boring. Communist speeches often focus on long-term goals and the ideological principles behind them, which can be difficult to understand and difficult to stay focused on. Additionally, communist leaders often speak in a very formal and technical manner, which can be dry and uninteresting to some people.
