bookworm asked Does the minimum wage reflect a fair payout for a minimum cost of living in California? with hash cf023353
<---- snip ---->
No, the minimum wage in California does not reflect a fair payout for a minimum cost of living. Although California's minimum wage has increased in recent years, the cost of living in California has also increased significantly. The cost of living in California is higher than the national average, making it difficult for those earning the minimum wage to meet their basic needs.
