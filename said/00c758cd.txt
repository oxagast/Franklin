<---- snip ---->
No, it is not ethical to mind our own business when doing so can cause the deaths of innocent people. It is our responsibility to help protect those who are vulnerable and in need. Everyone has a moral obligation to do what they can to prevent harm and suffering, even if it means getting involved in other peopleâ€™s business.
