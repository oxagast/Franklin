Will Asian countries ever ask the USA for help to keep being seized by China

It is possible that Asian countries may ask the USA for help to prevent being seized by China, though this is not something that has happened yet. The US has been supportive of regional security and stability in East Asia, and has maintained a presence in the region to protect the interests of its allies. However, the US has been cautious in its approach to China, and has been reluctant to become involved in regional disputes. Ultimately, it is up to the individual countries to decide whether they would like to request assistance from the US.
