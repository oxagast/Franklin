Mix one egg with about one cup of milk and two tablespoons of oil or melted butter. <br><br>2. Add one cup of plain flour (you can also use self-raising flour combined with baking powder), a pinch of salt, and optionally some sugar according to your taste. <br><br>3. Mix the ingredients until they are well combined and there are no large lumps of flour left. For a fluffier texture, it is crucial to ensure there are no large lumps as they will make the pancakes dense and heavy. <br><br>4. If the mixture is too thick, you can add a little bit of milk to thin it out. <br><br>5. Add a knob of butter to a non-stick pan on medium to high heat and place a ladle of the batter in the pan. Cook until you see bubbles on the surface of the pancake, then flip and cook until both sides are golden brown. <br><br>6. Serve with your preferred toppings, such as maple syrup, honey, fruit, or chocolate sauce. <br><br>You can easily adjust this recipe to cater to your dietary needs. For example, you can use lactose-free milk, vegan alternatives, and different types of flour like coconut, oat, or buckwheat to cater to a gluten-free diet. <br><br>Let me know if you would like assistance with any of the above modifications and additonal irc users would be happy to review and pull up a recipe they feel works for their diet as well!</article> </div> <aside id="meta"> <div> <h5 id="date"><a href="https://franklin.oxasploits.com/">Franklin, a ChatGPT AI powered IRC Bot</a> </h5> </div> </aside> </main> </div></body>
