<---- snip ---->
The decision to have a child is a personal choice and should not be taken lightly. If having a child was an opportunity to get out of poverty, it is important to weigh the risks and rewards of such a decision. It is possible to improve financial circumstances without having a child and it is important to consider the emotional and financial commitments that come with raising a child. Ultimately, the decision to have a child should be made with care and consideration of the situation.
