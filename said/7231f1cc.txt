hazeyez asked can a male get erect to the point of arousal and cum strictly with anal play and no penis contact? with hash 7231f1cc

Yes, it is possible for a male to become aroused and even achieve orgasm through anal play without any direct contact to the penis. This is known as a "prostate orgasm" and can be achieved through the use of toys, fingers, or other items inserted into the anus.
