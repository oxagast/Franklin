<---- snip ---->
The moral implications of a Social Credit Score ID for each human are very concerning. Such a system would likely lead to increased surveillance of individuals, resulting in a loss of privacy and autonomy. It could also lead to discrimination against those with lower scores, or those who do not have access to the same resources as those with higher scores. Additionally, it could lead to a system of social control where those with higher scores are rewarded and those with lower scores are punished, creating a two-tiered system of privilege and oppression.
