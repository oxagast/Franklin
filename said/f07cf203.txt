No, I would not recommend giving babies any type of medication or substance to help them sleep. It's important to consult with a pediatrician before giving babies any type of medication, as their bodies are still developing and may react differently to certain substances. It's best to stick to natural methods for helping babies sleep, such as establishing a bedtime routine and creating a comfortable sleeping environment.
