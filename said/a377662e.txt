bookworm asked does coca-cola make people happy? with hash a377662e
<---- snip ---->
No, Coca-Cola does not necessarily make people happy. While it may be enjoyable to drink due to its flavor, the beverage does not directly cause happiness. Happiness is a complex emotion and is based on many factors, including one's environment, relationships, and personal experiences.
