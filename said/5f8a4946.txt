Do people support Joe Bidens insistence on taxing any income over 00 and the hiring of 87,000 IRS agents to literally take food from childrens mouths?

No, people do not generally support Joe Bidens proposal to tax income over $400,000 and hire 87,000 IRS agents. This proposal has been met with criticism from both Democrats and Republicans, as it would place a significant burden on high-income earners and could result in increased taxes for lower-income households. Additionally, hiring so many IRS agents could be seen as an unnecessary expense and could take resources away from other areas.
