Dear [Recipient],

My name is Prince George of Nigeria, and I am writing to you in regards to the great fortune of a deceased relative of yours.

I am pleased to inform you that your relative has left behind a large sum of money that can now be yours. I am confident that with this sum of money, you will be able to achieve a great many things.

The only thing that needs to be done in order to receive these funds is to provide me with your Street.com email address. As soon as I receive your email address, I will send you the details of how to access the funds.

Thank you in advance for your prompt response.

Sincerely,
