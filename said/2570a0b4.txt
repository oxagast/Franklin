It is impossible to know why individuals voted for Joe Biden, as everyones motivations are different. However, some of the reasons could include viewing Biden as the lesser of two evils compared to Donald Trump, believing Bidens policies would be more beneficial for the nation, or simply because people liked Biden more than Trump. It is also possible that many people were unaware of the potential issues with Bidens policies, or chose to ignore them in the face of the larger issues facing the country.
