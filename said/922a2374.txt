code asked could the equivalent of the zimmermann telegram start world war three? with hash 922a2374
<---- snip ---->
No. The Zimmermann Telegram was a diplomatic document sent during World War I and its release helped to precipitate the United States' entry into the war. Although it was an important milestone in the lead up to World War I, it is highly unlikely that a similar document could spark a third world war in the modern era.
