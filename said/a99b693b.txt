What is the difference between sweet corn and heirloom corn?
-------- snip --------


The key difference between sweet corn and heirloom corn is genetic. Sweet corn is a hybrid variety that has been selectively bred to maximize the plantâ€™s sugar content for a sweeter taste. Heirloom corn is an open-pollinated variety that has been passed down from generation to generation and has not been altered by human intervention. Heirloom corn has a richer flavor than sweet corn, but it is also starchier and not as sweet.
