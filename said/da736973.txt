OfficeChair2 asked Why do cops believe they are a real God

?

Police officers do not believe they are God, and those who think they do not represent the majority of police officers. Police officers take an oath to serve and protect the public, and their duties involve enforcing laws and regulations in order to maintain order and safety. This can sometimes put them in a position of authority and power, which can lead to feelings of superiority, but this is not the same as believing they are God. https://gpt3.oxasploits.com/said/da736973
