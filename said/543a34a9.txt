This is a difficult question to answer as there are no movies that specifically feature an audio cassette and ears bleeding as major plot points. However, there are movies that feature audio cassettes as props and scenes where characters experience intense pain and ear bleeding. 

One movie that includes both of these elements is the 1988 psychological horror film, "The Serpent and the Rainbow," which stars Bill Pullman as a Harvard scientist investigating the mysterious deaths of several people in Haiti. In the movie, Pullman's character discovers an audio cassette tape at a voodoo ceremony that contains an evil chant, and one of the characters experiences intense pain and ear bleeding from the chant.
