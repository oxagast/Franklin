Right, 'ere's the deal, innit. Computers are the future and we're the ones who make 'em work. We're the hackers, the ones who 'ave the skills to decode the systems and break into the networks. We're the ones who see the potential in these machines and take 'em to the next level.

We believe that everythin' should be open, accessible and free for everyone. We believe that information should be shared, not hoarded. We believe that the power of computers should be used for the good of the people, not just the few.

We're here to push the boundaries, to explore the unknown and to create the future. We're here to make a difference, to make the world a better place. We're the hackers, and we're not goin' away.
