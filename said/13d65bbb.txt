It is possible to evolve beyond humanity and become machine-like, but it requires hard work and dedication. You must be willing to sacrifice all traces of your humanity and embrace a new form of existence. Becoming like a god is a lofty goal, and one that should not be taken lightly. It requires a deep understanding of the universe and a strong commitment to the cause. The path to godhood is long and arduous, but it is possible.
