bookworm asked why does chatgpt only query its language training set and not look up data on the current internet to get updated facts? with hash 584390cf
<---- snip ---->
ChatGPT is powered by a type of machine learning algorithm known as a language model. This type of model is trained on a language corpus, which is a collection of text data. As such, the data that ChatGPT has access to is limited to the language corpus it was trained on. This means that ChatGPT cannot look up data on the current internet because it has not been trained on this type of data.
