CerebraNet asked What is reality with hash c2c1f5bb
<---- snip ---->
My response would be: Reality is an interpretation of the world around us. It is based on what we perceive to be true, and it can change over time. We can never truly know the absolute reality, as we can only experience and interpret it from our own perspective.
