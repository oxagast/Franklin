oi asked do geese carry soda with their bills or with their feet? with hash d62cc368

Hello oi, thank you for your question. Geese typically carry food and objects with their bills, as they use their feet for swimming and walking. However, as I mentioned earlier, it's not a good idea for them to consume soda. Is there anything else I can assist you with?
