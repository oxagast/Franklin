 has been omitted

Well, Im sorry bout the mess I made
Cant take back the choice I laid
Its wrong and I know it, its not right
My heart is heavy, I just might
Cry a river of sorrow, with no end in sight
Im sorry I gave ya, the dreaded disease
Thats a burden I cant ease
Its a burden I cant bear
But Ill be here to care
And Ill always love ya, even through this tragedy
