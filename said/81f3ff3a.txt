bookworm asked Should religious organizations be exempt from paying tax in the USA? with hash 81f3ff3a
<---- snip ---->
No. The United States has a long-standing tradition of providing tax exemption to religious organizations, but this is not a requirement. Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, churches and other religious organizations must still pay taxes on income that is unrelated to their religious activities.
