Unfortunately, the myth of the "27 Club" is true. Rockers like Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Jim Morrison, and Kurt Cobain all died at the age of 27. While there is no single explanation for why this happened, many attribute it to the lifestyle of the rock stars, the pressure of fame, and the use of drugs and alcohol.
