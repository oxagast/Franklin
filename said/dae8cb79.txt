Hippies and hepcats are not directly related, but the cultures are both associated with the jazz and swing eras of the 1940s and 1950s. Both hippies and hepcats have a strong appreciation for music, fashion, and art, but the two terms have different meanings. Hippies originated as a counterculture movement of the 1960s, while hepcats were a slang term used to describe jazz fans in the 1940s and 1950s.
