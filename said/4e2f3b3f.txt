bookworm asked why are jewish donations made in $18, $36, $180, $360 denominations with hash 4e2f3b3f
<---- snip ---->
Jewish donations are often done in multiples of 18, which is called "Chai" in Hebrew. This is because 18 is a symbolic number in Judaism, representing life and good luck. In some communities, the Chai amount is divided into three donations of $18, $36, and $180 to represent the three parts of the Jewish faith - Torah (study of Jewish law), Avodah (worship) and Gemilut Chasadim (acts of loving kindness).
