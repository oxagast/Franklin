captain asked Arch linux ftpd config location not vsftpd with hash 9f06ac86
<---- snip ---->
Arch Linux does not use vsftpd, so there is no configuration file for it. The default FTP server used in Arch Linux is the Pure-FTPd server. The configuration file for this server is located at /etc/pure-ftpd.conf.
