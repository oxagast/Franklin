The story of the Garden of Eden in Genesis is often interpreted as an allegory for a spiritual journey of humanity. It is seen as a representation of the human experience, from the innocence of creation, to the knowledge of good and evil, to the consequences of disobedience and exile from the Garden. It is also seen as a representation of the struggle between God and humanity and the consequences of sin.
