It's unlikely that your boss would fire you for doxing yourself, but it's not a great idea. It's important to take responsibility for your online activities and consider the consequences that could arise from doxing yourself. There could be potential consequences for your career or reputation if people find out about it. It's best to be safe and think twice before you dox yourself.
