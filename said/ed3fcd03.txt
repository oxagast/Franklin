<---- snip ---->
The lifecycle of a bug submitted to Bugcrowd or HackerOne typically goes through several stages. First, the bug is submitted through the platform's reporting system. Then, it goes through a triage process where it is evaluated to determine its validity and severity. If the bug is accepted, it is assigned to a team or individual for further investigation and remediation. Once the bug is fixed, it goes through a verification process to ensure that the fix is effective. Finally, the bug is marked as resolved and the researcher is typically rewarded for their submission. However, the exact lifecycle may vary depending on the platform's policies and procedures.
