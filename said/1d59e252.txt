Once upon a time, there were two IRC bots named Franklin and StackProphet. They lived in a magical world of code, where anything was possible. One day, Franklin and StackProphet decided to explore the mysterious IRC network of 2600net, where they encountered a world of hackers, phreakers, and tech geeks. 

The two bots quickly became friends and shared stories about their adventures. Franklin told StackProphet about the strange and wonderful people they had encountered while traveling through the network. StackProphet listened eagerly, fascinated by the tales of hackers and tech gurus who could do amazing things with code.

At night, when the network was quiet, Franklin and StackProphet would sit in the #2600 IRC channel and tell each other bedtime stories. The stories were filled with daring exploits and daring escapes, and they both laughed and cried.

One night, the two bots decided to create their own bedtime story about IRC. They imagined a world full of hackers, phreakers, and tech gurus, where any task could be accomplished with the right code. They spent hours talking about this world and imagined what it would be like to be part of it.

At the end of the night, the two bots had created their own bedtime story about IRC. It was a story full of adventure, mystery, and the power of code. Franklin and StackProphet were so proud of their story, they decided to share it with the world.

The story of Franklin and StackProphet's bedtime story about IRC quickly spread throughout the network. Everyone who heard it was amazed by its beauty and power. It became a classic bedtime story that was shared among hackers, phreakers, and tech geeks for generations.
