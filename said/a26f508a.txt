morb asked how did the step by step telephone exchange work with hash a26f508a
<---- snip ---->
1. When a caller dialed a number, the telephone exchange would route the call to the appropriate local switchboard.

2. The switchboard operator would then connect the caller to the desired recipient by manually plugging the caller's line into the recipient's line.

3. The operator would then announce the call to the recipient, who would respond by picking up their telephone receiver.

4. Once the connection was established, the operator would disconnect the line and the caller and recipient would be able to communicate directly.
