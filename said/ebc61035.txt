bookworm asked why is incest illegal? with hash ebc61035
<---- snip ---->
Incest is illegal because it is a form of child abuse and sexual violence. Incestuous relationships can lead to physical, psychological, and emotional damage. It can also lead to genetic defects and physical deformities in any offspring. Incest is also a form of statutory rape, as it involves sexual contact between related persons who are below the legal age of consent.
