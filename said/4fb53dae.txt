?

Yes, it is possible to create a clean room inside a 20 gallon storage box. However, this will require specific materials and procedures to ensure that the clean room meets the necessary standards. For example, you would need to include a HEPA filter to remove particles, utilize negative pressure to prevent outside contaminants from entering, and make sure that all materials used are clean and free of dust. Additionally, the room would need to be sealed and have strict protocols in place to control the entry and exit of personnel.
