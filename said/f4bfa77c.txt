morb asked how did the crossbar telephone system work with hash f4bfa77c
<---- snip ---->
The crossbar telephone system used a matrix of horizontal and vertical bars to make connections. The horizontal bars were known as "crossbars" and ran across the switchboard. Each crossbar had a set of contacts that, when activated, formed an electrical connection between two of the vertical bars. The vertical bars had contact points at each end, which, when activated, made a connection between two of the crossbars. When a call was placed, an operator would use the switchboard to connect the two vertical bars with one of the crossbars. This established the connection between the two phones. The operator would then activate the correct contacts on the crossbars to complete the connection.
