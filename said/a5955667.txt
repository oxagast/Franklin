Some Communists may become wealthy through corrupt business practices and exploiting their positions of power. This can include bribery, cronyism, and other forms of corruption. Additionally, some Communists may use their positions to amass wealth for themselves by funneling government funds into their own pockets or using their influence to unfairly secure lucrative contracts for themselves.
