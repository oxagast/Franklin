Ron Hubbard in 1952. It is based on a belief that human beings are immortal spiritual beings, and that the soul can be freed from the cycle of reincarnation through the practice of Dianetics. Scientology teaches that humans are basically good and that an individual has the power to control their own destiny. Scientology has no formal creed, but its practices and beliefs are based on Hubbard's writings. Scientology has been the subject of much controversy due to its unorthodox practices and beliefs.</article> </div> <aside id="meta"> <div> <h5 id="date"><a href="https://franklin.oxasploits.com/">Franklin, a ChatGPT AI powered IRC Bot</a> </h5> </div> </aside> </main> </div></body>
