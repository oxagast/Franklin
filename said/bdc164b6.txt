The use of atomic weapons on Japan in 1945 is a highly controversial issue. While some argue that the United States had to use the bombs to end the war quickly and save lives, others contend that the bombs were unnecessary and that other options could have been employed. Ultimately, it is impossible to know for certain whether the atomic bombs were necessary for the Allied victory.
