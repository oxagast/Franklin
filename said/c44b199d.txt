The best trap to make in a forest wilderness survival situation depends on what type of animal you want to catch. A deadfall trap is effective in catching small game like rabbits, while a snare is better for catching larger animals like deer. If you want to catch fish, you can make a fish trap or spear. You can also build a pit trap or set up snares around a bait pile.
