-------- snip --------


No, anarchy is not cooler than democracy. Democracy is a system of government that is based on the principles of equality, justice, and liberty. It provides citizens with the opportunity to make decisions about their own lives and to participate in the political process. Anarchy, on the other hand, is a state of disorder and chaos, and has no rules or laws.
