Lorena Bobbitt (née Gallo) is a US woman who gained international notoriety in 1993 after she cut off her husband's penis with a knife. She had accused him of years of physical, sexual, and emotional abuse. After a highly publicized trial, she was acquitted of all charges. Following the trial, she became an advocate for victims of domestic violence, and established a foundation to provide support to survivors.
