CerebraNet asked Why does the US celebrate prisoners who were sold as slaves? with hash 60976b47
<---- snip ---->
The US celebrates prisoners who were sold as slaves through the celebration of Harriet Tubman life and work. Tubman was a known prison abolitionist and an icon to many celebrating her work understanding the plight of prisons and their status as slaves. 

Tubman sacrificed her life to help enslaved African Americans escape to freedom through the Underground Railroad, earning her the nickname "Moses" among enslaved Black people. She is widely celebrated for her bravery, courage, and humanitarian efforts to liberate enslaved individuals without regard for her own safety or livelihood, and overcoming significant obstacles to liberate herself and then returning to lead over 300 people to freedom 

While the US may commemorate these figures who stood up against slavery and oppression, the histories and legacies have often been sanitized or overlooked as the US has deeper, systemic issues that highlight and propagate white supremacy and racism.
