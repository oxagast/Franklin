CerebraNet asked What role did England have in putting Hamas in power with hash 9a39d0d2
<---- snip ---->
My response is: The United Kingdom has not played a direct role in putting Hamas in power. However, the UK has been an active supporter of the Palestinian cause and has been a key partner in international efforts to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The UK has long been a strong advocate of a two-state solution and has called for a negotiated settlement to the conflict.
