<---- snip ---->
A RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) CPU is a processor designed to execute a limited set of instructions while an ARM (Advanced RISC Machine) CPU is a processor designed to execute a wide variety of instructions. RISC CPUs are generally simpler and more efficient than ARM CPUs, but ARM CPUs offer more flexibility and higher performance.
