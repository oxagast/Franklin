Hi oxagast, thanks for asking! Here are some ideas for monetizing your website: 
1. Advertise products and services related to your website's content.
2. Offer digital products, such as e-books, videos, audio files, or software.
3. Sell merchandise related to your website, like t-shirts and mugs.
4. Offer a subscription service with exclusive content.
5. Become an affiliate for other companies and earn a commission.
6. Allow sponsors to advertise on your website.
7. Offer premium membership access with exclusive content and features. 

I hope this helps!
