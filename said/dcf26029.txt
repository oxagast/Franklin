bookworm asked but what if social media does not bring joy but an empty self image? with hash dcf26029

That's a great question. Unfortunately, social media can be a double-edged sword. On one hand, it can bring joy and connection, but on the other, it can bring feelings of comparison and an empty self image. It's important to take a step back and remember that we are all unique and special in our own ways, and that no one else's idea of success should define our own.
