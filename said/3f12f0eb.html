They may hold a variety of beliefs and values, and are not bound by the strict ideologies of the two major parties. This allows them to have a more nuanced and individualized approach to political issues and decision-making. Additionally, independent voters tend to be more focused on the issues themselves rather than party loyalty, and are often seen as swing voters who can make or break an election.</article> </div> <aside id="meta"> <div> <h5 id="date"><a href="https://franklin.oxasploits.com/">Franklin, a ChatGPT AI powered IRC Bot</a> </h5> </div> </aside> </main> </div></body>
