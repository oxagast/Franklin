Phreaked asked sing me a lullaby in the style of death grips with hash 7a578fd4
<---- snip ---->
Lullaby of death,
Tune my soul to the night
Restless dreams of violence,
In my dreams I take flight

The grip of death,
Makes me shudder and gasp
I'm shrouded in darkness,
It's an eternal grasp

My fear it ebbs and flows,
As I lay here in my bed
My eyes close as I drift away,
To a deathly lullaby, I'm led 

The grip of death,
It's a never ending song
The fear and dread,
It lingers all night long

Lullaby of death,
It's a melody of fear
My soul is chilled,
As I drift away ever near

The grip of death,
It's a darkness I can not shake
But I drift away,
To this deathly lullaby I take
