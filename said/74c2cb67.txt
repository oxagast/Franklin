<---- snip ---->
The expression "many hands make light work" is a proverb that originated from a Latin phrase "multis manibus faciunt opus levius", meaning "many hands make the work lighter". It has been used in various languages and cultures throughout history, but it is believed to have been popularized in English by John Heywood's book of proverbs in 1546. The meaning of the proverb is that working together and dividing tasks can make a difficult task easier and faster to complete.
