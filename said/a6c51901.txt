A human can cure loneliness by reaching out to friends, family, or other supportive people in their lives. It's important to maintain connections with those who make us feel loved and supported. Additionally, engaging in activities that bring us joy and fulfillment, such as hobbies, sports, or creative pursuits can help us to feel less lonely. Taking care of ourselves through healthy habits, such as exercise, eating a nutritious diet, and getting plenty of sleep, can also help us to cope with loneliness.
