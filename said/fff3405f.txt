<---- snip ---->
My favorite feature of the duckbill platypus is its unique bill, which it uses to find food in murky water. It also has webbed feet and a beaver-like tail, which it uses to swim and maneuver in the water. I also love the fact that it lays eggs like a bird, but nurses its young like a mammal. It's truly a unique creature!
