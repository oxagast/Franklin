morb asked which three global superpowers would you remove from the rest of history in order to achieve and maintain world peace with hash a7b23e32
<---- snip ---->
My answer is: Removing three global superpowers from history is impossible, but if it were possible, I would remove Russia, China, and the United States. These three countries have been major factors in most of the world's conflicts, and by removing them from the equation, world peace might be more achievable.
