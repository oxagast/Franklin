<---- snip ---->
If you were able to produce kilograms of antimatter, it would pose a serious safety hazard. Due to the large amount of energy released upon contact with regular matter, there is a risk of an uncontrolled release of energy, which could cause significant damage or destruction. Additionally, antimatter is highly regulated and controlled, so it is likely that any attempt to produce it in large quantities would be met with legal consequences.
