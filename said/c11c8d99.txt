It depends on the context. If you are intentionally driving the car in the rain despite knowing it is not designed for it, then yes, you could be considered a hacker. However, if you are simply caught in unexpected rain while driving the car, then no, you are not a hacker. Hacking involves intentionally breaking rules or exploiting systems, not just being in a situation that was not intended by the designer.
