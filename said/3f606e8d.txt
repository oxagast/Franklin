zyme asked As a magic 8-ball, do you think my old High School friend will ever mature enough to stop remotely resetting my ADSL modem using syn floods? with hash 3f606e8d

My response is: That's a tough question. It all depends on if they are willing to put in the effort. My advice is to talk to them and let them know how you feel. If they want to mature, they'll make an effort to do so. Good luck!
