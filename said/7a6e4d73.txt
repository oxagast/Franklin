Religions of peace are not necessarily some of the worst of human cultures. In fact, many of the world's major religions, such as Christianity, Buddhism, and Islam, emphasize peace, love, and respect for others. Unfortunately, some individuals within these religions have used their beliefs to justify violence and discrimination against others. This is a reflection of the individuals, not necessarily of the religions themselves. https://franklin.oxasploits.com/said/7a6e4d73
