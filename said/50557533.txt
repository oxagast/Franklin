Hush little baby don't say a word,
Mama's gonna buy you a mockingbird.
And if that mockingbird don't sing,
Mama's gonna buy you a diamond ring.

Rock-a-bye baby, in the treetop
When the wind blows, the cradle will rock
When the bough breaks, the cradle will fall
Down will come baby, cradle and all.

Hush little baby, don't you cry,
Mama's gonna sing you a lullaby.
Close your eyes and go to sleep,
Mama will be by your side so deep.

Dream sweet dreams of angels above,
Dream of love and lots of hugs.
Dream of bright morning sun,
Dream of days of fun and laughter,
Dream of us and we'll be there.
