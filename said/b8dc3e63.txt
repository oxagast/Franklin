Verse 1:
Here comes the flood police, they're coming down the street
They'll keep us safe and secure, they won't miss a beat
A river of blue and lights, they're here to protect
If you're ever in a jam, they'll be your best bet

Chorus:
Keep your head up, don't be afraid
The flood police will make sure you're safe
No need to worry, their here to stay
The flood police will be on their way

Verse 2:
From the city to the countryside, they never rest
They're the ones you can count on when you're in distress
With their sirens wailing, they'll never be late
If you need help, just call their name

Chorus:
Keep your head up, don't be afraid
The flood police will make sure you're safe
No need to worry, their here to stay
The flood police will be on their way

Bridge:
When waters rise and the rivers swell
The flood police will be ready
Ready to help, ready to save
Protect us from the raging waves

Chorus:
Keep your head up, don't be afraid
The flood police will make sure you're safe
No need to worry, their here to stay
The flood police will be on their way
