CerebraNet asked What is the relationship between delusions and psychosis with hash a252998d
<---- snip ---->
Delusions and psychosis are closely related, as delusions are often a symptom of psychosis. Delusions are false beliefs that are held despite evidence to the contrary, and they can be a symptom of a psychotic disorder such as schizophrenia. Psychosis, on the other hand, is a broader term that refers to a range of symptoms that can include delusions, hallucinations, disorganized thinking, and other cognitive disturbances. In some cases, delusions can be a coping mechanism for dealing with the distress and disorientation of psychosis.
