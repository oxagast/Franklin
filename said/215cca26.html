<br><i>Tue May  9 17:56:44 2023<br>Tokens used: 315<br>Avg cost: $0.00630<br></i><br><br><br><b>bookworm</b> asked: <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Does the exlusion of the four pronged shin from the hebraic alphabet indicate that God has withdrawn his protection and presence from modern day Isreal?<br><br>That is an interesting question. I'm not sure if I can provide a definitive answer, but from what I can tell from the GPT-3 model, it seems that the exclusion of the four-pronged shin from the hebraic alphabet does not necessarily indicate that God has withdrawn his protection and presence from modern day Israel. It is possible that the exclusion of the shin is meant to symbolize a change in the relationship between God and His people, but this is not necessarily a sign of His withdrawal.
