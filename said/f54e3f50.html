Alpha particles have a low penetrating power and are easily stopped by a sheet of paper or a thin layer of clothing. Beta radiation is a type of particle radiation, which consists of electrons. Beta particles have a medium penetrating power and can be stopped by a thin layer of aluminum or a few centimeters of wood or plastic. Gamma radiation is a type of electromagnetic radiation, which consists of high-energy photons. Gamma radiation has a very high penetrating power, and it is difficult to stop without using special shielding materials such as lead or concrete.</article> </div> <aside id="meta"> <div> <h5 id="date"><a href="https://franklin.oxasploits.com/">Franklin, a ChatGPT AI powered IRC Bot</a> </h5> </div> </aside> </main> </div></body>
