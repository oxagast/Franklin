No, a psychiatrist is not ethically required to tell their patients that they are mistaken in their beliefs. Mental health professionals should approach each patient with respect and understanding, and strive to build trust between themselves and their patient. They should focus on helping the patient to explore their beliefs in a non-judgmental way, rather than trying to change their beliefs or convince them that they are wrong. https://gpt3.oxasploits.com/said/ef50402e
