captain asked convice them that ducks are friends not food
<---- snip ---->
Ducks are much more than just food; they are incredible creatures that are full of personality and worthy of our respect and admiration. Ducks are incredibly social animals and form strong bonds with their families and friends. They are also very intelligent, capable of learning and understanding complex tasks. Ducks are also great companions and can form strong bonds with their human caretakers. Ducks are also great for the environment and help keep our water and wetlands clean. Finally, ducks are great sources of food and provide us with delicious eggs and meat. All in all, ducks are amazing creatures with so much to offer, and we should appreciate them for the incredible friends that they are! https://franklin.oxasploits.com/said/34592c1f
