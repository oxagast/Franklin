It was a cold December day in 1945. The Nazis had won a decisive victory over the Soviets in World War II and Adolf Hitler was now the leader of the world.

The Nazis had conquered all of Europe and their military forces had pushed the Soviets out of their territory. Hitler had managed to unite Europe under one banner and had created a powerful global network of allies.

The world was now under Nazi rule and the people had no choice but to obey Hitler's orders. Hitler had become a powerful dictator and had started to implement his own set of laws and regulations.

Hitler had also started to influence global politics and had managed to create a powerful alliance with Japan, Italy and several other countries. This alliance had become a formidable force in the world and Hitler was now seen as a powerful leader.

Hitler was now in control of the world and no one could stop him. He was now unstoppable and his reign of terror had begun.
