<---- snip ---->
My response is: Other key combinations that may work to unlock the keyboard of an Asus ROG laptop include pressing the key combination of Fn + Left Shift + F11. You can also try pressing the key combination of Fn + F6. If these key combinations do not work, it may be necessary to contact Asus support for further assistance.
