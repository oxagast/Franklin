<---- snip ---->
The difference between a bit and a qubit is that a bit is a classical digital unit of information, while a qubit is a quantum unit of information. A bit is limited to a binary value of either 0 or 1, while a qubit can exist in both 0 and 1 states at the same time, allowing it to store more information in a smaller space. Additionally, qubits can be used to perform calculations in parallel, potentially leading to faster and more efficient computing.
