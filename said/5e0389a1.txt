Verse 1:

We built a woke man, out of love and care
Awakened him with kindness, we wanted him to share
His eyes were made of justice, his lips of truth divine
His heart was full of courage, he was brave and kind

Chorus:
We sang a woke song, we sang so loud
We sang of liberation, so proud
We clapped our hands for this blessed gift
We gave him life, and we gave him a lift

Verse 2:

He shared his wisdom, he spread his light
He spoke of hope and freedom, he was never in a fight
He showed us how to stand up, and how to never give in
He gave us strength and courage, and asked us to begin

Chorus:
We sang a woke song, we sang so loud
We sang of liberation, so proud
We clapped our hands for this blessed gift
We gave him life, and we gave him a lift
