Tell me about what happened to WordStar after the mid-1990s.
-------- snip --------


WordStar was the worlds most popular word-processing program in the early 1980s, but its dominance in the market began to decline in the mid-1990s. By this time, Microsoft had established itself as the leader in office productivity software, and WordStar was unable to compete. WordStar was eventually acquired by a company called WordStar International in 1997, and they released a new version of the program in 2000. However, this version was not well received, and the program eventually ceased development in 2004. WordStar is now considered a legacy program, and is no longer widely used.
