What is one attitude problem that affects all humans?
-------- snip --------


One attitude problem that affects all humans is a sense of entitlement. People often feel that they are entitled to certain rights, privileges, or opportunities without having to put in the work or effort necessary to earn them. This attitude can lead to feelings of frustration, anger, and resentment when these entitlements are not granted.
