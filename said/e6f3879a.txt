No, it is not possible that we will live in a future where a woman will go to a gene bank to first have a male's genes tested for suitability or quality before being allowed to copulate. This is because it is not possible to accurately measure the quality of a person's genes, and it would be unethical to limit someone's reproductive choices in this way.
