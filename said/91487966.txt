<---- snip ---->
Chlorine is used to make water potable, but the exact amount of chlorine required depends on factors such as the amount of contamination in the water, the pH level, and the temperature of the water. Generally, a chlorine concentration of 0.5 to 1.0 parts per million (ppm) is enough to make water potable.
