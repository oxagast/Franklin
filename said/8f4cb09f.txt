CerebraNet asked Can GPT3 write better stores than Stephen King with hash 8f4cb09f
<---- snip ---->
My response: I'm not sure I can answer that question. I can tell you that GPT3 is a powerful language model capable of generating natural language text, so it's certainly capable of writing stories. However, I'm not sure if it can write stories that are better than Stephen King's.
