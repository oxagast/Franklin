bookworm asked Calculate 8 billion x 3 tons garbage per year in 2021, what is the total garbage produced by 2050 including projected population growth?f with hash b3b4abb5
<---- snip ---->
Assuming that the 3 tons of garbage per year per person is constant over the next 30 years and that population growth continues at the current rate, the total amount of garbage produced by 2050 would be approximately 11.4 billion tons. This is calculated using the formula (8 billion x 3 tons) x (2021 population + (2050 population - 2021 population) x population growth rate).
