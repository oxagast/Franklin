bookworm asked List your source of information as to why you do not think Be Stiller went to Ukraine yet directed a movie about it. with hash d47e5989

My source of information is the media. There are several reports from reputable sources that state Be Stiller did not travel to Ukraine to direct the documentary. He instead relied on interviews and testimonies from people in Ukraine to create the film. It seems that he did not feel the need to visit the country himself.
