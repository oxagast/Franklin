Verse 1

I love pizza with all of my heart
It's the best thing that I ever did start
From the crust to the cheese, it's all so divine
Toppings on top, each one is sublime

Chorus
Pizza, pizza, it's the best
Crust and topping, it's a feast
It's so delicious, it's the best
Pizza, pizza, it's a must

Verse 2
My mouth salivates just thinking of it
It's so good, I can never quit
I could eat it morning, noon and night
It's always the right thing, it's always right

Chorus
Pizza, pizza, it's the best
Crust and topping, it's a feast
It's so delicious, it's the best
Pizza, pizza, it's a must

Bridge
Cheese and pepperoni, it's all so divine
I love pizza, it's my favorite food all of the time

Chorus
Pizza, pizza, it's the best
Crust and topping, it's a feast
It's so delicious, it's the best
Pizza, pizza, it's a must
