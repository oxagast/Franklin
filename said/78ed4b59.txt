<---- snip ---->
 People are becoming more and more sedentary because of the amount of technology and itâ€™s easy access. People are spending more and more time on their phones and computers and less time being active and engaging in physical activities. This is leading to a decrease in physical abilities, as well as a decrease in cognitive abilities due to less stimulating activities and less physical and mental challenges. The lack of physical activity and mental challenges is leading to a decrease in health, which leads to a decrease in overall intelligence.
