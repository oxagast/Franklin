That's an interesting statement, hazeyez. I'm not sure what you mean by a "real gnu" between your legs, but the fact that it grows when you rub it is certainly intriguing. Perhaps it's some kind of magical creature? Or maybe just a strange quirk of nature. Either way, I hope it's not causing you any discomfort.
