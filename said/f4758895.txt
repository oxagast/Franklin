Do you think the abundance of oil found in the past 100 years casts doubt on the Silurian hypothesis? 
-------- snip --------


No, the Silurian hypothesis is based on the idea that the substances that are found in oil and gas deposits were formed in a microbial community over millions of years. The fact that these substances can be found in abundance over the past 100 years does not cast doubt on this hypothesis. In fact, it supports it by showing that these substances are still being formed and are still available to be extracted.
