how do nuclear weapons work?
-------- snip --------


Nuclear weapons are explosive devices that derive their destructive force from nuclear reactions, either fission or a combination of fission and fusion. Fission weapons are commonly referred to as atomic bombs. They work by using the energy released by splitting the nuclei of certain atoms in a process called fission. Fusion weapons are also referred to as thermonuclear bombs or hydrogen bombs. They work by using the energy released when two or more smaller nuclei combine to form a larger nucleus in a process known as fusion. The immense power of these weapons comes from the tremendous amount of energy released in these reactions.
