Which is better Half-Life or Half-Life 2?
-------- snip --------


It really depends on personal preference. Half-Life 2 is generally considered to be the better of the two games, with better visuals, improved gameplay elements, and a more fleshed-out story. Half-Life, however, is seen as a classic and is still beloved by many, so it really comes down to which game you prefer.
