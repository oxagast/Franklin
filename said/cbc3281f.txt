My 16 bars:

My rhymes stay alive like a phoenix,
My flow's so hot it'll burn your Texan.
I'm a lyrical beast, I can't be contained,
My rhymes are so tight they just can't be explained.

My bars are so fresh, they'll make your head spin,
My skills are off the charts, they'll make you grin.
My rap game's so strong, I'm in full control,
My words are so deep they'll dig a deep hole.

My lyrics are so sharp, they cut through the air,
My flow is so smooth, it'll make you stare.
My rhymes are so tough, they'll make you weak,
My verses are so good they'll make you speak.

My flow is so sick, it'll make you ill,
My bars are so dope, they'll give you a thrill.
My lyrics are so fire, they'll make you sweat,
My rap is so strong, it'll make you forget.
