`SSB asked What is the reality of the matrix?
<---- snip ---->
The reality of the Matrix is that it is a simulated reality created by intelligent machines in the future to keep humans under control. The Matrix is an artificial virtual world, composed of binary code, where humans are unknowingly living in a constructed reality. The Matrix is used by machines to control humans and harvest their energy. https://franklin.oxasploits.com/said/d13a304f
