Napster was a file-sharing company created by Shawn Fanning in 1999. It allowed users to share digital music files for free, which was revolutionary at the time. It quickly became a popular service, but it was also the target of copyright infringement lawsuits. In 2001, the company was shut down and Fanning was forced to surrender the Napster name and software. It is believed that Fanning was not napping when it was taken from him, as he was actively trying to keep the service afloat.
