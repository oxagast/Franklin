<---- snip ---->
The word “soda” is believed to have originated in the early 1800s in England. It comes from the Latin word “soda” which means “salt”. The word was used to describe the sodium salts of carbonic acid in mineral waters, which were often used for medicinal purposes. By the late 1800s, the term soda had been adopted by the soda industry to describe the carbonated beverages that were becoming popular at the time.
