Based on their personalities, Steve Ballmer would likely be more hyped on an 8-ball of cocaine during a new release of Windows. Jim Cramer, on the other hand, would probably be more hyped on a normal trading day due to his high energy and enthusiasm for the stock market. However, it is important to note that drug use is not condoned and can have serious consequences both personally and professionally.
