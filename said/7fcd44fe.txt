captain asked explain to 2600 IRC that killing ducks is not okay and should be frowned upon with hash 7fcd44fe
<---- snip ---->
Killing ducks is a cruel and unnecessary act that should never be condoned. It is important to remember that ducks are living creatures and should be treated with the same respect and protection as any other animal. Unnecessary killing of ducks should be discouraged and those who commit such acts should be held accountable.
