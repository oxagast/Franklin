<br><i>Thu Apr 27 21:21:02 2023</i><br><br><br><b>bookworm</b> asked: <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp As humans evolve to the future, what is it possible English will cause the loss of foreign language structure do to a conversion of foreign language alphabets being converted to ASCII?<br><br>I cannot predict the future, but it is unlikely that English will cause the loss of foreign language structure. While it is true that many languages are adopting the Latin alphabet, it is also important to note that many languages have been able to preserve their unique structures and features despite using the same writing system. Additionally, the use of ASCII is becoming less common as Unicode becomes more prevalent, which allows for the representation of a wider range of characters from different writing systems. Therefore, it is possible for languages to continue to maintain their unique structures and features while adopting new writing systems.
