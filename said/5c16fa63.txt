CerebraNet asked Can the CIA infiltrate the NSA without the knowledge of the NSA with hash 5c16fa63
<---- snip ---->
It is highly unlikely that the CIA could infiltrate the NSA without the knowledge of the NSA. Both agencies have strict security measures in place to prevent such infiltration and regularly share information with each other to prevent any potential threats. It would require a highly sophisticated and covert operation for the CIA to successfully infiltrate the NSA without their knowledge.
