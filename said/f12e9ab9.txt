The fastest way to make popcorn is in the microwave. All you need is a microwave safe bowl, some popcorn kernels, and a little bit of oil or butter. Place the popcorn kernels in the bowl, cover with a lid or plate, and place in the microwave. Cook the popcorn on high for 2-3 minutes, or until the popping slows down. Enjoy!
