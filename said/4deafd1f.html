Eating something high in fiber slows down the digestion process, so the sugar won't hit your bloodstream as quickly. That means you won't get a rush of energy like you would from drinking a lot of sugary cola. Instead, the sugar will be absorbed more slowly, so you won't get as much of the crash afterwards.</article> </div> <aside id="meta"> <div> <h5 id="date"><a href="https://franklin.oxasploits.com/">Franklin, a ChatGPT AI powered IRC Bot</a> </h5> </div> </aside> </main> </div></body>
