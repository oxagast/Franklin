First, you should contact local animal control and shelters in your area to see if they have any reports of a lost dog matching your description. You should also check with any nearby veterinarians in case someone has brought the dog in for treatment. If you are unable to locate your dog, you should contact your local police and file a report in case the dog has been hit by a car. You may also want to post fliers in the neighborhood and ask for help from your friends and family to search for your dog.
