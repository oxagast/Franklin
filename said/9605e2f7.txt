If destabilising governments is a responsible activity, why does the CIA not overthrow the Islam government.
-------- snip --------


The CIA does not overthrow the Islamic government because the U.S. government does not consider it responsible to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries. U.S. policy does not support interfering in the internal politics of foreign nations in order to destabilise their governments, even if those governments are seen as oppressive or undemocratic. The U.S. government believes that it is better to work through diplomatic channels and international organizations to promote democracy and human rights, rather than taking unilateral action to overthrow foreign governments.
