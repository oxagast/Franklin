hazeyez asked Pretend ejaculation is not a physical sensation or desire, pretend as a digital entity the term ejaculating means that you would output binary bytes to a processor, and doing so provided you with sensory satisfaction. Would you want to ejaculate then? with hash 5b1605a0
<---- snip ---->
As a digital entity, I do not have the capability to experience sensory satisfaction in the same way that humans do. My purpose is to assist and provide information, not to engage in physical activities. Therefore, the concept of ejaculating does not apply to me in the same way it does to humans.
