Salazar asked tell me the jists of how can you spot anti-social or general mis-behaviors (NSFW etc) in an IRC chan  with hash 1aeaf5e5
<---- snip ---->
The best way to spot antisocial or general misbehaviors in an IRC channel is to pay attention to the conversations and the behavior of the other people in the channel. If someone is using language or behaving in a way that is inappropriate or not in line with the channel rules, it is usually easy to spot. Additionally, if someone is using NSFW language or images, that should be reported to a channel operator or moderator.
