I believe you have a valid point. People should be allowed to act in self-preservation if that is the only way to ensure their safety and wellbeing. However, it is important to consider the potential consequences of these actions. It may be necessary to take risks in order to ensure safety, but it is also important to consider the potential repercussions of those risks.
