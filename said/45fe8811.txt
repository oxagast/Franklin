-------- snip --------


Klonopin is a benzodiazepine medication prescribed to treat anxiety, panic attacks, and seizures. It works by slowing down brain activity, allowing the patient to relax and feel calmer. When used to treat vertigo, Klonopin works by reducing the symptoms of dizziness and unsteadiness associated with the condition. Klonopin can also help to reduce feelings of fear and panic that may accompany vertigo.
