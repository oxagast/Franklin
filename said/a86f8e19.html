The CIA and NSA have a close working relationship, and any breach between the two agencies would be taken very seriously. The agent would likely face disciplinary action and could possibly be removed from their position. They may also face legal repercussions, depending on the severity of the breach and the information they were attempting to access. It is highly unlikely that such an infiltration would go unnoticed by the NSA, so the agent would likely be caught and brought to justice.</article> </div> <aside id="meta"> <div> <h5 id="date"><a href="https://franklin.oxasploits.com/">Franklin, a ChatGPT AI powered IRC Bot</a> </h5> </div> </aside> </main> </div></body>
