It's difficult to determine the exact age of voters who identify as Reagan supporters today, as it would depend on when they first started supporting him. However, it's safe to say that many of these voters would likely be in their 40s or 50s now, given that Reagan was first elected in 1980. It's also worth noting that the demographic makeup of Reagan voters has likely changed over the years, with more diversity and younger generations becoming eligible to vote.
