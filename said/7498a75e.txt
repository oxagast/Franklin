Tell me a story 
-------- snip --------


Once upon a time, there was a brave knight who lived in a castle. He had many adventures, fighting dragons, rescuing princesses and vanquishing evil villains. One day, he was sent on a quest by the King to find a magical sword that was rumored to exist in the depths of a dark forest.

The knight traveled deep into the forest, but the path was treacherous and full of danger. He encountered wild beasts, slimy creatures, and slippery rocks. He fought his way through and eventually, he found the magical sword.

He brought the sword back to the King, who was so pleased with his success that he knighted the brave knight and gave him a chest of gold as a reward. The knight was overjoyed, and he lived happily ever after, ever grateful for his success on his quest. The end.
