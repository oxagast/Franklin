jhex asked Is Xylitol safe for consumption?  Also, what is the maximum amount of stevia that is safe to consume in 1 day? with hash aed80a49
<---- snip ---->
My response is: Xylitol is generally considered safe for consumption, and is commonly used as a sugar substitute. The maximum recommended daily dose of stevia is around 4-6 milligrams per kilogram of body weight. However, it is not recommended to exceed more than 10 milligrams per kilogram of body weight in any given day.
