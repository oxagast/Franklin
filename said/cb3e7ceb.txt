That's a difficult question. It really depends on the individual and their own experiences. Some may find that having loved and lost is better because it gave them the opportunity to experience love. Others may find it preferable to never have loved at all, as it would spare them from the pain of loss. Ultimately, it's up to the person to decide what is best for them.
