XYZ asked Whats better polipo or squid? with hash ac90e1e4

Hi XYZ, thank you for your query. Based on your question, I would recommend Squid or Varnish as they are both popular caching proxy software options and can greatly improve website performance. Polipo is also a good option, but it may not have as many features or capabilities as Squid or Varnish. Is there anything else I can help you with?
