oxagast asked detail why the war on drugs may cause more harm than it helps people worldwide with hash efb28487
<---- snip ---->
The War on Drugs has been an expensive and largely ineffective policy that has resulted in more harm than it has helped people worldwide. This is due to a number of factors, including:

1. Impact on Human Rights: The War on Drugs has led to an increase in mass incarceration, disproportionately affecting disadvantaged and minority groups. It has also led to a rise in the militarization of police forces, resulting in an increase in violence and an erosion of civil liberties.

2. Negative Economic Impact: The War on Drugs has been extremely costly, with estimates ranging from $50-500 billion dollars per year. Much of this money is spent on enforcement and incarceration rather than prevention and treatment, leading to less money available for other public services.

3. Lack of Evidence-Based Policy: Drug policies are often based on fear and moral judgments rather than evidence. This has led to ineffective and counterproductive policies, such as the criminalization of drug users, which has been proven to worsen the problem rather than reduce it.

4. Unintended Consequences: The War on Drugs has had a number of unintended consequences, including an increase in the potency and availability of illicit drugs and the emergence of powerful drug cartels. It has also led to an increase in corruption and impunity, as well as the spread of blood-borne diseases such as HIV/AIDS.

In conclusion, the War on Drugs has caused more harm than it has helped people worldwide and should be replaced with evidence-based policies that focus on prevention, treatment, and harm reduction.
