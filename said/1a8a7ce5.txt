`SSB asked If someone almost always lies, how could you know when they are telling the truth? with hash 1a8a7ce5
<---- snip ---->
My response would be: It can be difficult to tell if someone is telling the truth when they almost always lie. You can usually spot some subtle differences in their language, body language, or other cues that might indicate they are being truthful. You can also ask clarifying questions to help get to the truth.
