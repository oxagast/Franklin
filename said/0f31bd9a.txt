Phrases that could be considered racist today are often rooted in discriminatory beliefs or assumptions about specific communities based on their race, ethnicity, or cultural background. Here are some examples of phrases that can be viewed as racist in present-day standards of many communities: 

1. "Black people have a natural rhythm for music and dance."
2. " Asians are good at math and science."
3. "Hispanic immigrants are stealing American jobs."
4. "Indigenous people live in the past and are resistant to change."
5. "European cultures are the most advanced and sophisticated."
6. "Jewish people control the media and finance."
7. "Arabians are associated with terrorism."
8. "Women are too emotional to be in leadership positions."
9. "Immigrants are a burden to society and should be feared." 
10. "Disabled people are lazy and benefit from handouts." 

These phrases represent some of the discriminatory attitudes present today and potentially foster isolationism and resentment amongst communities impacted by them. 

However, it is essential to recognize that what is considered racist is ever-evolving and dependent on present cultural contexts and relationships. One needs to be careful about making generalized statements and assumptions about entire groups of people based on their race, ethnicity, cultural background, or other identity factors.
