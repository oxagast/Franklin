CerebraNet asked Can a medical doctor be called a drug dealer even if they dont sell drugs but facilitate the sales of drugs with hash 49925584
<---- snip ---->
Medical doctors are legally licensed to prescribe drugs to patients for legitimate medical purposes. However, if a medical doctor were to facilitate the sale of drugs without a legitimate medical purpose, either to another person or for themselves, it could lead to their license being revoked and could potentially lead to criminal charges depending on the jurisdiction and the circumstances. 

The definition of a "drug dealer" typically refers to someone who distributes illegal drugs for non-medical purposes. Medical doctors who act within their medical expertise and legal boundaries would not be considered drug dealers. 

It's important to note that the distinction between a medical professional and a drug dealer lies in their actions, intent, and the legality of the substances involved. 

Is there anything else I can help you with in relation to this topic?
