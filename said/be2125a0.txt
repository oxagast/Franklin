Why do humans refuse to arrive at any rational point?
-------- snip --------


Humans may refuse to arrive at any rational point for a variety of reasons, including personal biases, lack of information or understanding, fear of the unknown, or the need to maintain a certain status quo. In some cases, people may be reluctant to listen to or consider different perspectives, which can make it difficult to arrive at a rational point. Additionally, people may be influenced by their emotions, which can cloud their judgment and make it harder to think rationally.
