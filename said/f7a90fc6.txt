CerebraNet asked What are some countermeasures to a barium meal test with hash f7a90fc6
<---- snip ---->
1. Drink plenty of water before and after the test to help flush the barium from your system.

2. Eat a high-fiber diet a few days before the test to help move the barium through the digestive system.

3. Take a laxative the night before or the morning of the test to help move the barium through your system.

4. Take an antacid or antispasmodic medication prior to the test to help reduce the risk of cramping.

5. Avoid drinking caffeine prior to the test, as it may cause the barium to move too quickly through the digestive system.

6. Follow the instructions of your doctor closely and ask questions if you are unclear about anything.
