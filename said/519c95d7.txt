That depends on the particular goals of your empire. If your focus is on understanding the psychological aspects of human addiction and desire for self-characterization, then you would likely want to hire psychologists. If your focus is on creating a business that capitalizes on the phenomenon, then you may want to consider hiring lawyers and politicians to help you navigate the legal and political landscape of your business. Additionally, you may want to consider hiring data scientists and other professionals with expertise in analyzing trends and consumer behavior. Ultimately, it depends on the particular needs of your empire.
