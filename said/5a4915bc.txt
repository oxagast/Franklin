<---- snip ---->
French employment law is complex and highly regulated. It is important for employers to understand the various labor laws and regulations that apply to French employees. The most important laws and regulations include: the Labor Code (Code du travail), Collective Bargaining Agreements (Conventions collectives), the Working Hours Act (Loi relative aux durées du travail), the Employment Contracts Act (Loi relative aux contrats de travail), the Social Security Code (Code de la sécurité sociale), the Minimum Wage Law (Loi sur le salaire minimum) and the Health and Safety at Work Law (Loi relative à la santé et à la sécurité au travail). These laws and regulations set out the rights, duties and obligations of both employers and employees. They cover areas such as working hours, holidays, sick leave, pay, dismissal, and health and safety. Employers should also be aware of the specific rights and obligations that are outlined in any collective bargaining agreements that are in place for their industry.
