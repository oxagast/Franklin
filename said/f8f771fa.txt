<---- snip ---->
Hacking companies that are known to cause harm to the population is illegal because it is considered to be a form of cybercrime. Cybercrime is a serious crime that can result in significant fines, imprisonment, and other forms of punishment. Companies that are known to cause harm to the population are often considered to be a threat to public safety, and thus it is illegal to hack these companies. Furthermore, hacking can be used to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data and information, which could be damaging to the company or individuals.
