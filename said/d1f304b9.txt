<---- snip ---->
1. Limited context understanding: ChatGPT is not able to understand context properly, and is likely to create results with incorrect grammatical structure or lack of understanding.

2. Limited understanding of conversational nuances: ChatGPT is not able to detect and respond to the nuances of conversational language, such as jokes, sarcasm, and subtlety.

3. Lack of personalized responses: ChatGPT does not take into account the individual personalities of the users, and thus does not generate customized responses.

4. Limited use of external data sources: ChatGPT does not use external data sources such as images, videos, and audio, which limits its ability to provide accurate results.

5. Poorly trained models: ChatGPT is only as accurate as the training data that is used to create the model. If the model is not trained properly, it can lead to inaccurate results.
