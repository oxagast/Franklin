hazeyez asked why do ballsacks sweat? with hash 365d8b9b
<---- snip ---->
Ballsacks sweat because the skin in the area is delicate and lacks the sweat glands and follicles that other parts of the body have. Sweating is the body's natural way of cooling itself, so the sweat in the area helps keep the testicles cool.
