There are many ways that a farmer can have fun with cucumbers. One way is to create cucumber sculptures. This can be done simply by cutting cucumbers into interesting shapes and arranging them on a plate or platter. Another fun way to use cucumbers is to make cucumber relish or pickles. This is a great way to preserve the cucumbers for later use and also adds a unique flavor to dishes. Finally, a farmer could have fun with cucumbers by making cucumber spa treatments.
