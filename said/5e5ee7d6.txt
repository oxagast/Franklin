-------- snip --------


No, Islam is not responsible for violating the laws of North African countries against promoting slavery. Islam has long been an advocate for the abolition of slavery and condemns any practice that would exploit or oppress people. North African countries have their own laws and regulations governing slavery and have taken steps to end the practice within their borders. Islam does not condone any form of slavery and has been instrumental in advocating for its abolition.
