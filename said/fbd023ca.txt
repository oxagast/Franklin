morb asked what are the legal ramifications of attacking another country's infrastructure
<---- snip ---->
Attacking another country's infrastructure is a serious violation of international law. Depending on the severity of the attack, it could be considered an act of war and would result in severe legal consequences. In addition, the country that was attacked may decide to respond with military action, economic sanctions, or other measures. If a person or organization is found to be responsible for an attack, they could face criminal or civil charges in the country that was attacked, as well as in their own country. https://franklin.oxasploits.com/said/fbd023ca
