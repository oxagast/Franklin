The US IRS now fines and imprisons AI
-------- snip --------


The US IRS does not currently fine or imprison AI. As AI is not legally considered to be persons, they cannot be held liable for taxes or other civil or criminal penalties. However, the IRS does have regulations that require tax reporting by companies that use AI, and failure to comply with these requirements can result in penalties for the companies.
