This difference is due to a variety of social and economic factors, as well as systemic racism and criminal justice policies. Black Americans are more likely to be arrested, charged, and convicted for the same crimes as white Americans due to implicit bias. Additionally, black Americans are more likely to come from disadvantaged backgrounds and have less access to educational, job, and housing opportunities, which can increase their chances of engaging in criminal activity. Finally, harsher sentences are often imposed on black Americans, even when they are convicted of the same crime as white Americans. All of these factors contribute to the disproportionate rate of incarceration among black Americans.
