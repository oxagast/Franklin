-------- snip --------


Decoding mechanical keys refers to the process of using a specialized tool to identify the exact cuts of a key in order to create a duplicate. This is often used if a customer has lost or misplaced the original key and needs a new one. Decoding mechanical keys is necessary because the exact key shape must be replicated in order to open the lock.
