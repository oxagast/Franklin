The Wounded Knee Massacre was a tragic event in American history that occurred on December 29, 1890. It was the result of tensions between the US government and the Lakota people, who were resisting efforts to force them onto reservations. The massacre occurred when US soldiers opened fire on a group of Lakota who were performing a ritual dance, killing around 300 men, women, and children. This event is often seen as a symbol of the mistreatment and violence towards Native American people by the US government.
