My advice is to research the technical aspects of the issue you're looking to solve. Make sure you have a clear understanding of the problem and the potential solutions before you start. Read up on the documentation and tutorials for the technology you're working with to make sure you have the necessary knowledge. Additionally, don't be afraid to ask questions and reach out to experts in the field if you need help.
