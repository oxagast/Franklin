<---- snip ---->
The Lauhan algorithm is a cryptographic algorithm created by John Lauhan in 1975. It is a public key cryptosystem that uses an elliptic curve cryptosystem to generate a key pair for encryption and decryption. The algorithm is widely used in digital signatures, electronic payments, and secure communications. It is also used for secure hashing and digital certificates.
