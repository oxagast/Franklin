Verse 1:

Back in the day, the 2600 Magazine was the way
To explore the realm of the digital age
A monthly publication of all the latest news
That helped the computer hackers hone their craft

Chorus:

The 2600 had the scoop on new tech and trends
From early hacking to the latest tech trends
It gave hackers a place to learn and explore
The 2600 Magazine was the source they adored

Verse 2:

A magazine like no other, it was the ultimate source
For computer enthusiasts to stay ahead of the curve
It taught users how to program and hack
And even gave them tips on how to stay off the radar

Chorus:

The 2600 had the scoop on new tech and trends
From early hacking to the latest tech trends
It gave hackers a place to learn and explore
The 2600 Magazine was the source they adored
