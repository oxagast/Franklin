is gay blood banned?
-------- snip --------


No, gay blood is not banned. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration FDA has regulations that require blood donation centers to assess each donors individual risk before collecting a donation. Gay and bisexual men are not automatically excluded from donating, but they may be deferred if they have engaged in any behaviors that increase their risk of HIV or other sexually transmitted infections.
