<---- snip ---->
Soylent Green would most likely be made from a combination of plant-based ingredients, such as soy, wheat, and other grains. It would also likely include added vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients. The ingredients would need to be blended together into a powder or paste, then packaged in a convenient form such as a bar, shake, or pill. It could also be made into a liquid form. Depending on the desired texture, texture-enhancing ingredients such as oils, thickeners, and emulsifiers could be added to the mixture. Finally, flavorings or sweeteners could be added to make the product more palatable.
