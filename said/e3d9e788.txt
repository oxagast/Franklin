write a spell that multiplies your herb cache
-------- snip --------


By the power of the Earth and its bounty,
Let this herb cache increase threefold by three.
Let the herbs I have stored grow and multiply,
To fill my larder with bounty and glee.

Let the plants I have tendered,
Grow and prosper and multiply,
Let the plants I have planted,
Thrive and spread throughout the sky.

Let my herbs grow and spread,
From here to eternity,
So that I may have plenty,
From this herb cache so free.

Let the herbs I have planted,
Grow and flourish and thrive,
Let their bounty and beauty,
Long remain in my sight.

By the power of the earth,
And its abundant supply,
I now call forth a blessing,
To multiply my herb cache threefold times three.
