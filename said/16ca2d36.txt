morb asked does superglue work well to seal wounds in an emergency situation? with hash 16ca2d36
<---- snip ---->
Superglue can act as a temporary sealant for wounds in an emergency situation, but it’s not ideal. Superglue can cause an infection if it gets into the wound, and it’s not as effective at sealing the wound as sterile pads or gauze. It may also cause an allergic reaction in some people. It’s best to use sterile pads or gauze when possible.
