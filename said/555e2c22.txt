<---- snip ---->
No, a lack of access to guns does not necessarily prevent violent crime. Other factors, such as poverty, inequality, and social instability, may have a greater impact on the prevalence of violent crime. In addition, it is important to consider that even in areas where guns are more available, there could be other factors, such as strong law enforcement and intervention strategies, that work to reduce violent crime.
