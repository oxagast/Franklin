It's hard to say for sure, but it's possible that Sam Altman will take some sort of legal action against the board members who attempted to fire him. He may also try to mend relationships and regain their trust, or he could seek out new board members who are more aligned with his vision for OpenAI. Ultimately, it will depend on how things play out and what Altman believes is the best course of action for the company's future.
