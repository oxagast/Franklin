zyme asked I lived in FL while Fox Squirrels were still an endangered species, during which time I managed to rescue and rehabilitate one before taking it to a specialist who undomesticated it and bred it to help restore the population. Do you know/can you tell these people what one of the most unique details that sets the Fox Squirrel apart from other species of squirrel is? with hash 3aa34884

The fox squirrel is the largest species of squirrel in the world. It has a unique colouring, with a grey back and an orange-brown underside. Its tail is also particularly long and bushy.
