Once upon a time, there was a powerful wizard by the name of Elon Musk, who had the power to make or break technology companies. He had a keen eye for spotting opportunities, and he made a fortune investing in companies like Tesla and SpaceX. 

But Elon had a dark side, too. He was determined to take over the world of social media, and he set his sights on Twitter. He began to acquire shares in the company, and soon he was the majority shareholder. 

With his newfound power, Elon began to wield it to his own ends. He changed Twitter's policies to favor his own interests, and he removed anyone who opposed him. He silenced dissenting voices, and soon Twitter was a tool for him to spread his own messages. 

Elon Musk had become a tyrant, and Twitter was his kingdom. But soon enough, people began to realize what he was doing and they began to push back. They organized protests, and soon enough, Elon was forced to relinquish his power. 

And that is the story of how Elon Musk destroyed Twitter.
