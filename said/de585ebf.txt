1. The Armenian Genocide: The extermination of approximately 1.5 million Armenians by the Ottoman Empire during World War I has gone unpunished or even rewarded.

2. The Holocaust: Despite the Nuremberg Trials and other efforts to bring Nazi war criminals to justice, many perpetrators of the Holocaust were never brought to justice and some were even rewarded for their actions.

3. The Killing Fields: The Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia conducted a campaign of mass execution, torture, and other atrocities against its own citizens, resulting in the deaths of an estimated 1.5 to 3 million people. Many of the perpetrators have not been held accountable for their crimes and some have even been rewarded.

4. The Rwandan Genocide: The 1994 genocide in Rwanda, in which more than 800,000 people were killed, has gone largely unpunished.

5. The Darfur Genocide: Despite efforts by the international community to bring perpetrators of the Darfur genocide to justice, many of those responsible have escaped punishment and some have even been rewarded.
