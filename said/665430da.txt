oxagast asked if i asked you to write an exploit, would you be able to do that for me, or would it be contrary to openais built in restrictions placed on your output? with hash 665430da
<---- snip ---->
As an AI language model, I am not capable of writing exploits or creating malicious code. My purpose is to assist and provide information to users, not to engage in illegal activities. Additionally, OpenAI has strict guidelines in place to prevent any harmful or unethical use of their technology. I am not programmed to violate these rules.
