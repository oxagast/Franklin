CerebraNet asked What role did the USA have in putting Hamas in power with hash 63d55041
<---- snip ---->
My response is: The United States did not play a direct role in putting Hamas in power. The US has, however, been critical of the Palestinian Authority and has expressed concern about the activities of Hamas. The US has also provided financial and military support to Israel, which some argue has enabled the occupation of Palestinian territories, and has opposed international efforts to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
