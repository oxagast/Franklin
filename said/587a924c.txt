what is fuzzing
-------- snip --------


Fuzzing is a software testing technique that involves providing invalid, unexpected, or random data as inputs to a computer program in order to locate coding errors and security flaws. It is a form of automated software testing and is used to find vulnerabilities in applications, operating systems, drivers, and other software. Fuzzing can be used to test for a variety of security flaws, including buffer overflows, SQL injection attacks, and code injection attacks.
