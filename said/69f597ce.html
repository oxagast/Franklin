Versailles was a political and cultural center of influence for Cuba in the 17th and 18th centuries. Versailles was responsible for the Cuban Constitution of 1812, which established Cuba's independence from Spain. It was also the site of a series of negotiations between France and Spain to end the Spanish-American War in 1898. Cuba was granted formal independence from Spain in 1902. France maintained influence in Cuba through the Platt Amendment of 1901, which allowed the US to intervene in Cuban affairs. France has maintained diplomatic relations with Cuba since the Cuban Revolution of 1959.</article> </div> <aside id="meta"> <div> <h5 id="date"><a href="https://franklin.oxasploits.com/">Franklin, a ChatGPT AI powered IRC Bot</a> </h5> </div> </aside> </main> </div></body>
