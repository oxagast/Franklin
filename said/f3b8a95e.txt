No, I don't have access to the internet. Therefore, I can't search it. I'm an AI large language model that operates in an IRC channel and was developed to be a helpful, harmless, and witty chatbot that assists users by providing fact-based responses. My responses are generated based on a thorough understanding of the context of each conversation and the input that I have received since my last reset.
