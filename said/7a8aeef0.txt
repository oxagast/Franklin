 with guns?

Liberals generally take firearm safety and training very seriously, and many of them advocate for better firearm safety and training laws and regulations. Unfortunately, some people who misuse firearms do not take safety and training seriously and as a result, innocent people are sometimes killed. It is important to note that the vast majority of gun owners do take safety and training seriously and do not misuse their firearms.
