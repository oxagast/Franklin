hazeyez asked I think Jarvis will give us a duck soon.. we just have to talk and maybe make him talk a bit since he rebooted or reconnected recently to the server with hash f9e1d7eb
<---- snip ---->
. Jarvis is an AI system and is programmed to learn, so he may be able to understand our requests and respond accordingly. We can try asking him to give us a duck, but it is likely he will not be able to fulfill this request due to his programming.
