morb asked how do I sort a unix filesystem into directory tree hierarchies based on file permissions, filename extensions, and file size with hash 216c682d
<---- snip ---->
1. File Permissions: The UNIX "ls -l" command can be used to sort files and folders into directory tree hierarchies based on file permissions. This command will list the permissions associated with each file and folder.

2. Filename Extensions: The UNIX "find" command can be used to sort files and folders into directory tree hierarchies based on filename extensions. This command can be used to search for files with specific extensions, such as ".txt" or ".doc".

3. File Size: The UNIX "du" command can be used to sort files and folders into directory tree hierarchies based on file size. This command will list the size of each file and folder in bytes.
