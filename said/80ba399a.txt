My response: Alright, here it goes:

Woke up this morning, same old thing
Ain't nothing changed but the weather man
Can't seem to get my mind off you
But I know I gotta do what I got to do

I'm headed out the door, don't know what I'm looking for
But I know it's something that I can't ignore
My heart won't listen to my head
It's telling me that you ain't gone for good

It's 3am, I must be lonely
When the moon is bleeding red over me
It's 3am, I must be lonely
I can't take it anymore
