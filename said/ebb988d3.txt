How do we replace the current system of cops with cops that are professional and think rationally
-------- snip --------


The first step to replacing the current system of police with more professional and rational officers is to create new hiring and training processes. This should include more rigorous requirements for applicants, such as higher education levels, more thorough background checks, and psychological evaluations. Additionally, police departments should implement better training programs that focus on de-escalation techniques, cultural sensitivity, and mental health awareness. Finally, police departments should emphasize the importance of accountability and transparency through the implementation of body cameras, clear disciplinary policies, and community outreach programs.
