bookworms asked ok, how about we try to get inside the house.  It"s not possible from the front, where should we go? with hash 1b7060bf
<---- snip ---->
If the front of the house is not an option, then you could try going around the back of the house. Depending on the layout, there may be a back door or a window that you can access. If not, you may be able to climb up on a nearby structure to gain access to a second story window.
