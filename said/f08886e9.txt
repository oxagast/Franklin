<---- snip ---->
The top five sorting algorithms used in computing are insertion sort, selection sort, merge sort, quick sort, and bubble sort. Insertion sort is a simple sorting technique that works by inserting each element from the list into its proper position. Selection sort works by finding the smallest element in the list and swapping it with the first element in the list. Merge sort divides the list into two halves, then sorts each half separately, and then merges the two sorted halves. Quick sort is a divide and conquer algorithm which works by selecting an element as a pivot and partitioning the list around the pivot. Bubble sort is a simple sorting technique that works by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
