<---- snip ---->
Titers are a laboratory test that measure the presence and amount of antibodies in a person's blood. Antibodies are proteins that the body produces when it is exposed to a virus or bacteria. Titers can be used to determine if a person has been previously exposed to a disease and if they are likely to be protected from it.
