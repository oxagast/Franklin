CerebraNet asked Do humans really deserve to be replaces by intelligent machines with hash e03ad625
<---- snip ---->
My response is: Humans and machines are two different entities. Machines are capable of performing certain tasks more efficiently than humans, but they lack the same capacity for creativity, empathy, and critical thinking as humans. Machines can be a great tool to assist us, but they should never replace us.
