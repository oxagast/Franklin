bookworm asked Do actors get elected as politicians due to populism? with hash c452a82c
<---- snip ---->
No, actors do not typically get elected as politicians due to populism. Actors may be popular and have a large following, but they do not necessarily have the political experience or knowledge necessary to be a successful politician. In order to be elected, actors would typically need to become actively involved in politics by joining a political party, volunteering on political campaigns and advocating for political causes.
