morb asked what happens if you don"t answer the phone after watching the ring tape with hash a5dba714
<---- snip ---->
If you don't answer the phone after watching the ring tape, the caller may continue to call or may eventually give up. If the caller is a telemarketer or automated message, they may continue to call until you answer or block the number. If the caller is a friend or family member, they may leave a voicemail and/or try to contact you in other ways.
