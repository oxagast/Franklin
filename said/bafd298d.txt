morb asked how do you field dress a deer? with hash bafd298d
<---- snip ---->
My answer is: Field dressing a deer is a relatively simple process. Start by cutting an incision from the breastbone down to the anus. Then, cut through the abdominal wall and remove the organs, being careful to keep the intestines and bladder intact. Finally, rinse the cavity out with cold water and hang the deer in a cool place to allow the meat to cool.
