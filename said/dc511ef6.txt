<---- snip ---->
Ducks are friends, not food, because they are living creatures that are capable of feeling pain, fear, and joy. Ducks also provide many benefits to humans, such as providing food, controlling insect populations, and providing recreational opportunities like hunting and birdwatching. Ducks are also part of the food chain and play an important role in maintaining a healthy ecosystem.
