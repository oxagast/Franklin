The Cambridge scandal, also known as the Cambridge Analytica scandal, is a political scandal that began in March 2018 when it was revealed that Cambridge Analytica had harvested the personal data of millions of people's Facebook profiles without their consent and used it for political purposes. The data was allegedly used to influence the outcomes of the 2016 US presidential election in favour of Donald Trump. The scandal led to a series of investigations in the US and the UK, and multiple lawsuits were filed against the company and its associates. Facebook also faced sanctions from the US Federal Trade Commission and was fined $5 billion for its role in the scandal. Cambridge Analytica has since ceased operations and filed for bankruptcy.
