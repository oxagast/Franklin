bookworm asked What does T. gondii do to the brains of rats that eat the infected shit of cats? with hash cf9300ef
<---- snip ---->
T. gondii can cause a neurological disease called toxoplasmosis in rats. It can alter the rat's behavior and lead to increased risk-taking and a decreased fear of cats. It is believed that the parasite does this in order to increase its chances of being eaten by cats, which is necessary for its life cycle. In addition, the parasite can also cause inflammation and damage to the brain, resulting in impaired learning and memory.
