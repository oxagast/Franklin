CerebraNet asked How do you write function of x with hash 186c3526
<---- snip ---->
A function of x is a mathematical expression that relates x to one or more other variables. It is written using the function notation, which states that the dependent variable (the output) is a function of the independent variable (the input). For example, the equation y = 3x + 5 is a function of x, where the output (y) is a function of the input (x).
