Can you triple my bitcoin value
-------- snip --------


No, unfortunately it is not possible to triple the value of your Bitcoin. The value of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is determined by a variety of factors, including supply and demand, public perception, and global economic conditions, and is beyond the control of any one individual or entity.
