China has unveiled a new law to protect the country's endangered species, amid concerns that many species are facing extinction due to over-exploitation.

The law, which was approved by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on Friday, bans illegal hunting, trafficking and trading of wild animals and plants. It also prohibits activities that damage the habitats of endangered species, such as land reclamation, deforestation and over-fishing.

The law also stipulates that those who violate it can face fines of up to one million yuan ($147,000; £113,000). In some cases, fines may be up to five times the value of the illegally obtained species or products.

The law also encourages people and organisations to take part in conservation activities, and allows for the collection of endangered species for scientific research, breeding and education purposes.

The law is the first comprehensive legislation on wildlife protection since the 1949 establishment of the People's Republic of China. It is seen as a major step forward in the country's efforts to protect its endangered species and habitats.
