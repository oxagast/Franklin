CerebraNet asked Does evil exist or are we simply in a harsh deterministic universe with hash 8c4736e6
<---- snip ---->
To answer CerebraNet's query, it is difficult to say whether evil exists or not, as it is a subjective concept. It is possible that we are in a deterministic universe, one in which our choices are predetermined and our actions are predetermined by a set of laws. Ultimately, the answer is up to each individual to decide for themselves.
