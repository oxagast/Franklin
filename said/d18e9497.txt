Yes, we can deduce from the Wikipedia article that the United States has participated in waterboarding. The article states that the technique was first used by the Spanish Inquisition and then by the United States during the War on Terror. It also mentions that CIA interrogators used it in the early 2000s, and that CIA officials have acknowledged its use.
