<---- snip ---->
Ford Motor Company had business dealings with Nazi Germany before and during World War II. Ford owned a German subsidiary, Ford Werke AG, which manufactured military vehicles for the Nazi war machine. The company also provided loans to the Nazi government and used forced labor in its factories. Although Ford was not directly involved in war profiteering, it did profit from its association with the Nazi regime.
