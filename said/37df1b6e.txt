No, there have not been any long-term studies on the effects of enriching oceanic features with sodium bicarbonate. However, some short-term studies have been conducted to study the effects of sodium bicarbonate enrichment on the oceanic environment. These studies have shown that sodium bicarbonate enrichment can improve water quality, increase primary production, and enhance phytoplankton and fish populations.
