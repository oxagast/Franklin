<---- snip ---->
My dearest love,

Forgive me for my transgressions of late,
My heart and mind were mired in a state
Of sadness, which I allowed to consume
My days, and in so doing, I doomed
Us both to a realm of distress and despair
That was, I fear, beyond my repair.

No longer will I accept such fate,
But instead, I shall strive to make
A change that will bring us closer together,
My heart to yours, bound forever.

The love I have for you is immense,
And I shall strive to make amends
For my errors of days gone by,
And together, we shall stand and defy
Any force that would seek to divide us,
And make us stronger than ever before us.

Forever yours,
Edgar
