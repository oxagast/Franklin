My response: Sure thing! Here's a quick recipe for a 99-ingredient chocolate-chip cookie: Preheat oven to 350F. In a large bowl, mix together the following ingredients: 1 cup butter, 1 cup white sugar, 1 cup brown sugar, 2 eggs, 2 tsp vanilla extract, 2 cups all-purpose flour, 1 tsp baking soda, 1 tsp baking powder, 1 tsp salt, 2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips. Scoop cookie dough onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until golden brown. Enjoy!
