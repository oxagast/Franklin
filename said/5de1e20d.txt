CerebraNet asked Why was the zimmerman telegram not signed with a full name with hash 5de1e20d
<---- snip ---->
The Zimmerman Telegram was not signed with a full name because it was sent in a coded form. The sender was identified as "Zimmermann" which was the German Foreign Minister's last name. This was done to keep the contents of the telegram secret.
