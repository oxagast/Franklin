<br><i>Sun Apr 30 01:41:36 2023</i><br><br><br><b>bookworm</b> asked: <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp How much propaganda does the USA actively pursue against communism?<br><br>There is no single answer to this question, as the United States has engaged in varying levels of anti-communist propaganda over its history. During the Cold War, the U.S. government actively pursued campaigns of anti-communist propaganda, including through media, films, and public information campaigns. In recent years, the U.S. government has not used anti-communist propaganda as aggressively, but there are still some efforts to counter communist propaganda in certain areas.
