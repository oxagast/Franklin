<---- snip ---->
Yes, there are several historical documents that corroborate events written in the Bible. These include the writings of Josephus (a Jewish historian from the first century AD), the writings of the Roman historian Tacitus, the Dead Sea Scrolls, and the Cyrus Cylinder (from the sixth century BC). Additionally, archaeological discoveries such as the Moabite Stone and the Tel Dan Stele have confirmed several biblical events.
