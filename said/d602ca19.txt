<---- snip ---->
RDNt was a hacker group that gained notoriety in the late 1990s for their attack on the Gibson Research Corporation. On April 15, 1998, the group hacked into the Gibson Research Corporation's mainframe and released the source code of the company's "Gibson Utilities" software package, which was a set of tools used to diagnose and troubleshoot computer problems. This attack was carried out via a "denial-of-service" attack which flooded the Gibson Research Corporation's servers with thousands of requests. As a result, Gibson Research Corporation was forced to temporarily take their systems offline to prevent further damage. This attack was one of the first public cases of hacking and was covered extensively by the media.
