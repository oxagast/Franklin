On March 26, 1997, a total of 39 members of the Heaven's Gate religious cult committed mass suicide in Rancho Santa Fe, California. The members believed that their deaths would allow their souls to board a spaceship that was supposedly following Comet Hale-Bopp. To commit suicide, they ingested a mixture of phenobarbital and apple sauce that had been laced with vodka.
