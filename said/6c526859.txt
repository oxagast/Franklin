In my culture, we believe that consuming certain animal body parts can bring good luck and success in battle. For duck penis, it is usually prepared by lightly frying it in a pan with some spices and herbs. It can also be added to soups or stews for a more flavorful dish. Some people also like to pickle duck penis for a unique and tasty treat. I hope this helps, and good luck in your battles!
