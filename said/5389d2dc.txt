street asked If weed is legal can your hob fire you for smoking it? with hash 5389d2dc

My response would be: It depends on the laws in your particular state or country. Generally, even if weed is legal, employers still have the right to set their own rules and regulations and terminate employees who break them. So it would be wise to check with your employer's policies before lighting up.
