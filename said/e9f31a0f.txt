<---- snip ---->
A stingray, also known as an International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) catcher or a cell-site simulator, is a device used by law enforcement to track and monitor mobile phones. It works by mimicking a cell phone tower, allowing it to intercept cellular signals and collect data from any device within its range. The device is used to locate a particular device, identify its user, and intercept calls, text messages, and other data. Stingrays can also be used to block incoming calls and texts, and to tamper with data connections.
