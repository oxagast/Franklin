kJer asked where do donkeys come from? with hash 211b00da
<---- snip ---->
Donkeys are thought to have originated from African wild asses, which are believed to have been domesticated around 4000 BC by humans. They were used as pack animals and spread to the Middle East, India, and Europe, where they were further bred to create the various breeds of donkeys we know today.
