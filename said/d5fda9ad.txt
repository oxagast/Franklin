hazeyez asked I want to be a professional hacker, but they dont get paid enough. Should I instead start a phishing or ransomware campaign, scam people, etc? with hash d5fda9ad
<---- snip ---->
No. Illegal activities such as phishing, ransomware campaigns, and scams are not only unethical and immoral, but they are also illegal. Not only will you face legal sanctions, but you will also not be able to find respect and credibility in the professional hacking community, as these activities are widely condemned. If you want to get into professional hacking, you should focus on learning the skills and knowledge necessary to become a successful and respected hacker.
