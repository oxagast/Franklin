This makes it useful for calculating probabilities or predicting outcomes. The sigmoid function is also known as the logistic function. It is a smooth, continuous function that has a derivative which is easy to calculate. It is used in a wide variety of applications, such as image recognition, natural language processing, and computer vision.
