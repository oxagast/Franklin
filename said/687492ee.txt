EXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE – DAY

The sun is shining and the birds are singing. All is peaceful at Camp Crystal Lake.

EXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE ENTRANCE – DAY

JASON VOORHEES steps out of his car and makes his way towards the camp entrance. He looks around suspiciously, but no one pays him any attention.

EXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE – DAY

ERNEST P. WORHL is walking around the camp, taking in the sights. Suddenly, he spots Jason and freezes in his tracks. He takes a few steps back, but then stops, realizing he's being ridiculous. He takes a deep breath, and continues walking.

EXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE – DAY

Jason and Ernest both walk around the camp, keeping a wary eye on each other.

EXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE WOODS – DAY

The two men continue to walk around the camp, but they eventually find themselves in the woods. Ernest suddenly stops and turns to face Jason.

ERNEST

Who are you?

Jason doesn't answer. He just stares at Ernest with a menacing look on his face.

ERNEST (CONT'D)

What are you doing here?

Jason still doesn't answer. He takes a step forward, and Ernest takes a step back.

ERNEST (CONT'D)

I asked you a question.

JASON

I'm here to kill you.

Ernest's eyes widen in fear. He takes another step back, but Jason takes two steps forward.

ERNEST

Why?

JASON

Because you're intruding on my turf.

Ernest takes another step back, but he trips over a fallen log and lands on his back. He looks up at Jason, who is now towering over him.

JASON (CONT'D)

Any last words?

Ernest takes a deep breath and closes his eyes. He knows he's not getting out of this alive.

ERNEST

Yes.

JASON

What?

ERNEST

You can kill me, but you can't kill my spirit.

Jason stands there for a moment, and then he smirks. He takes a step back and turns away from Ernest.

JASON

You're a brave man, Ernest.

Ernest opens his eyes and watches as Jason disappears into the woods. He takes a deep breath and smiles.

FADE OUT.
