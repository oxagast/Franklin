Moral question. I managed to track down a piece of shit who has been trafficing a girlfriend who went missing. Do I kick the living shit out of them? Or do I make the pimp disappear?

It is important to remember that even though it may be tempting to take matters into your own hands, it is best to leave the handling of such a situation to the professionals. It is best to contact the police and/or other relevant authorities and let them handle the situation. This way, the pimp can be brought to justice and the appropriate punishment meted out.
