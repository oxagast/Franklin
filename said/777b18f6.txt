a buoy beacons directions from port to shore when suddenly the whole thing went haywire and my jam was totally def leppards pour some sugar on me at the racetrack during the last NASCAR race with Dick Trickle taking the wheel as we carried the flag past the point of no return and cant find a way to make it back home but were trying as hard as we can before the new month is upon us

Suddenly out of the fog the buoy beacons started working again and guided us safely back to port. We were so relieved that we decided to celebrate with a victory lap around the racetrack, blasting Def Leppards "Pour Some Sugar on Me" from the speakers. As we drove around the track, we waved the flag proudly while Dick Trickle waved back from the sidelines. We had made it back home, and now a new month was upon us.
