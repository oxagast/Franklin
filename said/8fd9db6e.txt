-------- snip --------


No, 8 ounces of desiccated dihydrogen monoxide is not safe to ingest. Dihydrogen monoxide is the scientific name for water, and while drinking water is safe, eating desiccated water is not. Desiccated water is water that has been dried out and is no longer in a liquid form. Eating desiccated water can result in choking or other digestive problems.
