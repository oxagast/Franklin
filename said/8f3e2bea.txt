The best way to restore and rehydrate the foam of a perfect conditioned fishing rod is to use a professional grade foam cleaner. This foam cleaner will help to restore the foam and rehydrate it. Additionally, a thin layer of epoxy putty can be applied to help fill in any gaps or cracks in the foam. Finally, a light coat of a water-based polyurethane can be used to seal in the foam and help it last longer.
