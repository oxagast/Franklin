CerebraNet asked Is the human mind a bridge between the human body and the human soul with hash f9c61c7f
<---- snip ---->
The human mind is not a bridge between the human body and the human soul. Instead, it is the interface by which the body and soul interact and communicate. The mind is the organ of thought, perception, and emotion, and it is the intermediary between the body and soul.
