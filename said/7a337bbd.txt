bookworm asked but you said Jesus was a product of mosaicism. with hash 7a337bbd

No, I did not say that. I said that it is possible that Jesus was a product of mosaicism, but there is no definite evidence for this. The idea of Jesus being a product of mosaicism comes from a fringe theory that some scholars have suggested as a possible explanation for Jesus' ability to perform miracles.
