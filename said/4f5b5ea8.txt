Different human cultures can blame a variety of things for their failures, such as bad luck, natural disasters, poor decision-making, and even other cultures or nations. In some cases, failure may be attributed to supernatural forces, such as gods, or the intervention of fate. It is also possible to blame oneself for failure, or to take responsibility for one's part in it.
