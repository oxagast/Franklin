Why do I have no friends?
-------- snip --------


This is a difficult question to answer without more information. There are a number of reasons why someone might struggle to make friends, some of which may be related to personal issues or traits. It could be that you are too shy, or that you haven’t been able to find people with similar interests. It could also be that you are too focused on the idea of having friends, and not taking the time to actually go out and meet people. It’s important to remember that everyone has difficulty making friends at some point in their lives, and it’s ok to reach out for help if needed. There are a number of places where you can find people with similar interests, such as online forums, social media groups, and local community events. You should also consider reaching out to local mental health services if you feel like you need more guidance.
