Yes, public services like museums and libraries should be free. Free access to libraries and museums allows everyone to benefit from the educational and cultural resources they provide. It also encourages people to explore different topics and to continue learning outside of their traditional educational environments. Additionally, providing free access to these services helps to ensure that individuals from all backgrounds and of all socioeconomic statuses can benefit from them.
