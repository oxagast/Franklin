tell me what you know about positrac rear ends?

Positrac rear ends are a type of differential used in many cars and trucks. They use a clutch-based system to split the engineâ€™s torque between the two rear wheels. This helps to improve traction in slippery conditions and also helps to reduce wear on tires and other components. Positrac rear ends offer improved performance and greater efficiency compared to traditional rear ends.
