<---- snip ---->
1. Increase the difficulty of verifying accounts by requiring more information from users.
2. Institute a verification system for accounts that requires users to provide a valid phone number or other identifying information.
3. Use AI-based technologies to detect suspicious activity and account creation patterns, such as sudden spikes in account creation or suspiciously similar account profiles.
4. Utilize machine-learning algorithms to detect abnormal behavior and alert users when an account appears to be suspicious.
5. Require users to answer security questions before allowing them to post or interact with other users.
6. Monitor the content of posts and comments for suspicious language or other indicators of potential malicious activity.
7. Employ a team of human moderators to review flagged accounts and take appropriate action.
