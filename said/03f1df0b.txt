No, the national guard members that killed the Kent State University students do not deserve to be executed for "resisting" arrest. The Kent State tragedy was an awful event that is still remembered today, but the national guard members involved were found to have acted in self-defense and were not charged with any crimes. It is important to remember that the use of deadly force is only allowed when someone's life is in imminent danger, and the national guard members felt that was the case at the time of the incident.
