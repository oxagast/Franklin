CerebraNet asked Is there a name for when people mispronounce words but they claim they are using proper pronunciation with hash 06497f7a
<---- snip ---->
There is not a specific name for this type of mispronunciation, but it could be considered a form of cognitive dissonance or delusion. Some may also refer to it as willful ignorance or stubbornness. It is important to respectfully correct someone if they are mispronouncing a word, rather than assuming they are intentionally using proper pronunciation.
