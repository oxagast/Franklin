This is a difficult question to answer as everyone's opinion on this topic is subjective and personal. However, if two consenting adults are engaging in activities that involve their genitals touching, it is generally not considered to be gay. Ultimately it is up to each individual to decide what is and isn't considered gay in their own life.
