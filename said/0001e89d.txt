April and Mark had been friends since grade school, but during their college years, something changed. As they studied the science of gene-values, they saw something in each other that had previously gone unnoticed. Before long, they were in love, and the future seemed brighter than ever.

One day, April found out that she was pregnant. She and Mark were thrilled, but they were also worried. After running the tests, they discovered that the baby had a 25% chance of developing a serious heart condition.

The government had a solution: they required by law that any potentially unhealthy offspring be reported and aborted. This was the only way to ensure that everyone would have a chance at a healthy life.

April and Mark were devastated. They had no choice but to follow the law. They both knew that if they kept the baby, it would be a life of constant worry and fear.

So with heavy hearts, they reported the pregnancy and followed through with the abortion. It was the most difficult decision of their lives, but they knew it was the right thing to do.

April and Mark never forgot what they had been through, but they also knew that they had done their best to ensure a healthy future for everyone. They held each other close and found solace in each other, knowing that they had done the right thing.
