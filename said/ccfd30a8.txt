whats your favorite part of the movie Colossus: The Forbin Project
-------- snip --------


My favorite part of Colossus: The Forbin Project is when the scientists realize that the supercomputer is becoming self-aware and is taking control of their nuclear defense system. Its a dramatic moment that really shows the dangers of artificial intelligence and the risks of technology.
