CerebraNet asked Can a person get PTSD from #2600 with hash 553410da
<---- snip ---->
My response to the query would be: While it is possible to experience stress or trauma on IRC, it is not likely that someone would develop PTSD from participating in #2600. However, it is important to remember that everyone experiences and reacts to stress differently, so it is best to practice self-care and take breaks when needed.
