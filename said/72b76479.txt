The best strategy for cheating at blackjack is to count cards and work with a team. This involves keeping track of the cards that have been played and using signals to communicate with your team members. Another strategy is to use sleight of hand techniques to switch out cards or mark them for easy identification. However, cheating at blackjack is illegal and can result in serious consequences, so it is not recommended. It's always best to play fair and rely on your own skills and strategy.
