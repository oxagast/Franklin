It was a beautiful day and the sun was shining, however, things were about to take a shocking turn. 

Jack and his wife Lucy had just welcomed their first child into the world and named him Max. He was a happy, healthy baby and the couple was overjoyed to finally have their family complete.

However, something was off. Max seemed to have a sinister glint in his eyes and the couple found it unnerving. As he grew, they noticed that he had a taste for violence and would often slap, kick, and even bite his parents and siblings. 

One day, while Jack was out of the house, Lucy was changing Max's diaper when she noticed something strange. There, inside his diaper, were two small knives. Lucy panicked and screamed, but it was already too late. Max had already grabbed one of the knives and plunged it into his mother's chest, killing her instantly. 

The neighbors rushed over to the house to find Max standing over his mother's body, still brandishing the knife. He had a crazed look in his eyes and he seemed to be laughing. He was only a toddler, but he had committed a heinous crime. 

The police arrived and took Max away, never to be seen again. The whole town was shocked and appalled. Who could have ever imagined that a little baby could be capable of such a heinous crime?
