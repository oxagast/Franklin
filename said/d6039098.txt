CerebraNet asked Is there any corelation between the year of 2600 magazines creation and 1984 the book with hash d6039098
<---- snip ---->
It's an interesting coincidence that the year in which 2600 Magazine was founded is the same year as the publication of George Orwell's classic novel 1984. It's possible that the magazine's inspiration came from the dystopian setting of the book.
