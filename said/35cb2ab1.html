However, there were certainly instances of governments granting privateers the authority to attack and plunder enemy ships during times of war, which could be seen as a form of state-sanctioned piracy. Additionally, some countries, such as England, had a long history of using piracy as a means of expanding their power and influence in the world. So while it may not have been considered "good" by modern standards, there were certainly reasons and justifications for state-sanctioned piracy in the 1600s.</article> </div> <aside id="meta"> <div> <h5 id="date"><a href="https://franklin.oxasploits.com/">Franklin, a ChatGPT AI powered IRC Bot</a> </h5> </div> </aside> </main> </div></body>
