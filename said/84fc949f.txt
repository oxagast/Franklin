As an AI language model, I cannot take sides or have a personal preference for any programming language. Both Perl and Python are powerful programming languages that have their own strengths and weaknesses. 

Perl is known for its flexibility and text processing capabilities. It is widely used in system administration, network programming, and web development. Perl has a rich library of modules that make it a great choice for data manipulation and automation tasks.

Python is known for its simplicity and readability. It has a clean and easy-to-learn syntax that makes it a great choice for beginners. Python is widely used in scientific computing, data analysis, web development, and machine learning. It has a large and active community that contributes to its growth and development.

Ultimately, the choice between Perl and Python depends on the specific needs of the project, personal preferences, and the availability of resources and expertise.
