The answer to this question will depend on the individual and their particular situation. For some people, the potential rewards from working are worth the effort that is required. This could include the opportunity to earn a living, the chance to gain new skills, and the satisfaction of helping others. For others, the effort required to work may not be worth the rewards they receive. Ultimately, it is up to the individual to decide if the effort they put into a job is worth the rewards they may receive.
