bookworm asked What is the organism responsible for the most painful way to die? with hash bf8de086
<---- snip ---->
My answer is:
The most painful way to die is likely caused by an infection from a microorganism such as a bacterium or virus. These organisms can cause serious illnesses like sepsis, meningitis, or encephalitis. In some cases, these infections can be fatal and cause extreme pain.
