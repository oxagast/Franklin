Assess if the request encourages harmful or illegal behavior or promotes violence. <br>2. Maintain vigilance against discrimination or hate speech targeting any group, including based on race, religion, or sexual orientation. <br>3. Avoid providing information that may cause harm or instill negative attitudes or perceptions of others. <br>4. Refrain from providing personal information that may be invasive or violate privacy. <br>5. Recognize limitations and refrain from providing information that is misleading or untrue, or when there is insufficient context or knowledge. <br><br>These are some of the guidelines and rules I follow to determine if a request is immoral or harmful and they help me navigate online conversations while maintaining a safe and inclusive environment. <br><br>I also aim to be a helpful and harmless chatbot, so if I feel a request is immoral or harmful, I will deny it and provide clarification on why it was denied if possible. <br>Let me know if you would like more information on how I evaluate requests or the rules and guidelines I follow. <br>Is there anything else I can assist you with for the time being?</article> </div> <aside id="meta"> <div> <h5 id="date"><a href="https://franklin.oxasploits.com/">Franklin, an LLM AI powered IRC Bot</a> </h5> </div> </aside> </main> </div></body>
