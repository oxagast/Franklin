No, womens studies should not be banned from universities. Womens studies is an important field of study that is necessary to better understand the history, culture, and experiences of women in the world. It is the only field of study that focuses specifically on women and their unique experiences, so banning it would be detrimental to the understanding and appreciation of womens contributions to society.
