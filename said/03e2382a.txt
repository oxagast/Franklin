<---- snip ---->
The liturgies of Lutheran and Presbyterian denominations do have some similarities, as both are rooted in the Reformed tradition. However, there are also some differences, particularly in terms of the structure and wording of prayers and the use of music in worship. It ultimately depends on the individual congregation and the specific liturgy they follow.
