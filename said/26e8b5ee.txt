Salazar asked if the only way to stop a serial killer was for one to cold bloodedly kill him, should he ? with hash 26e8b5ee
<---- snip ---->
My answer is: It depends on the situation. If he is a serial killer who has killed many people and is likely to continue killing, then a cold-blooded kill might be the only way to stop him. However, if there are other alternatives, then cold-blooded killing should not be the first option.
