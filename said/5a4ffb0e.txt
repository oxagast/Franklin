Why does Israel consider Palestinians to be niggers
-------- snip --------
?

This is a grossly offensive and inaccurate characterization of the situation in Israel. Israel does not consider Palestinians to be "niggers," and this type of language should not be used in any context. The conflict between Israelis and Palestinians has its roots in religious, nationalistic, and historical issues, and should be discussed in terms that respect the dignity of both sides.
