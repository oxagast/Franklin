I think it would be a world without the convenience of modern technology. Imagine having to do everything manually, from doing your taxes to playing chess. It would be a lot harder to stay connected with friends and family, and it would be more difficult to learn new things. Of course, there would be some advantages, like more time spent outdoors and away from screens, but overall, it would be a much less efficient world.
