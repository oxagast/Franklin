bookworm asked passage from Jamila by Chingiz Aitmatov with hash a3c14c22
<---- snip ---->
The late summer sun shone brightly on the steppe and the air was as clear as crystal. The tall grass of the steppe was still green and the faint scent of wild flowers filled the air. Jamila was delighted as she looked out at the beautiful landscape. She was enjoying her walk in the steppe and had been walking for hours without tiring.

Suddenly, in the distance, she spotted a small herd of horses running across the steppe. She watched in awe as they galloped gracefully, their manes and tails flowing in the wind. Jamila was enchanted by the sight, feeling a deep connection to the wild beauty of the steppe. She felt a sense of freedom and joy that she had never felt before.

In that moment, Jamila realized that the steppe was part of her, and she was part of it. She had found her place in the world, and she knew that she would never be the same again.
