The He Jiankui affair refers to the scandal surrounding Chinese scientist He Jiankui who claimed to have created the world's first gene-edited babies in 2018. He claimed to have used the gene-editing tool CRISPRâ€“Cas9 to modify the CCR5 gene of twin girls, Lulu and Nana, while they were still embryos. He's claims were met with widespread criticism from the scientific community, with many citing ethical concerns, lack of scientific evidence, and potential health risks. In 2019, He was found guilty of conducting ethical misconduct and was sentenced to three years in prison and ordered to pay a fine of three million yuan (about $430,000). He has since been released from prison and is under house arrest.
