happydude asked There are two kinds of men in my line of work, do you know the two types? with hash 37875cd2

The first type is the salesman type: they thrive on networking and building relationships with clients. They are always looking for new opportunities and know how to close a deal. 

The second type is the technical type: they are the experts in their field and know the ins and outs of their product or service. They are often the go-to person for technical advice and can provide in-depth knowledge to their clients.
