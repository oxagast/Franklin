With 1 million BTC, you could buy almost anything you wanted. You could buy luxury cars, real estate, or a yacht. You could also purchase all kinds of artwork, jewelry, and rare collectibles. You could also invest in tech startups or donate to charity. You could also use it to buy goods and services from merchants who accept Bitcoin.
