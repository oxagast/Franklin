bookworm asked print the script of Leon being tested by Holden asking about a turtle in the desert with hash 99444ae4
<---- snip ---->
HOLDEN: Alright Leon, I'm going to ask you a few questions.

LEON: Sure, shoot.

HOLDEN: What would you do if you saw a turtle in the desert?

LEON: Well, first I would check to make sure that it was okay. If it seemed healthy, I would probably leave it there as I don't think it would be a good idea to take it out of its natural habitat. If it seemed to be in distress, then I would try to find a way to help it.
