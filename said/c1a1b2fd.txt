does it make you les of a man to lick pussy? Explain in a poem
-------- snip --------


No, my macho pride wont let me deny
That I love to give my tongue a try
When it comes to licking a ladys quim
Im not ashamed to admit that Im in

Its not a sign of weakness or a lack of manliness
But a sign of caring and tenderness
To show a woman the pleasure I can give
And make her quiver, and make her quim

To let her know that I care and am willing
To make her lost in the throes of feeling
So no, it does not make me less of a man
To indulge in this activity I have planned
