<---- snip ---->
Both IBM and Ford avoided economic sanctions against Nazi Germany by taking advantage of the loopholes in existing international trade laws. IBM was able to continue doing business in Germany by setting up a subsidiary in Switzerland and using Swiss currency for transactions. Ford was able to continue selling cars in Germany by using a network of international dealers to sell its cars in Germany. The company also used a Dutch subsidiary to supply parts to its German customers.
