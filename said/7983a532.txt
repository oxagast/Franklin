No, people who buy goods made in China are not responsible for China's imperialistic behavior. While their purchase may send money to China, it is not the same as directly funding imperialistic behavior. The Chinese government and individuals within the government are responsible for their own actions and should be held accountable for any imperialistic behavior.
