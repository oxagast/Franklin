<---- snip ---->
Hitler was in the war room, his face red with fury. He was yelling at his generals for their blunders and poor judgement. The walls of the room shook with the force of his voice.

But what the generals didn't know was that Hitler was also farting a lot. Each time he yelled, a loud fart would escape his behind, adding to the tension in the room.

The generals were embarrassed and tried to ignore Hitler's flatulence, but it was hard to ignore the smell that filled the room. Hitler himself seemed unaware of his own actions, and continued to yell and scold his generals.

Eventually, one of the generals couldn't take it anymore and he blurted out, "Sir, you're farting a lot."

Hitler was taken aback, and the room fell silent. He looked around sheepishly, realizing that he had been letting out clouds of gas while berating his generals. He quickly excused himself, mumbling something about needing to use the restroom.

The generals breathed a sigh of relief as Hitler left the room. They then continued their discussion, trying to figure out how to make up for the blunders they had made.

In the end, the war was won, but it was a close call. And from that day on, the generals always remembered to keep an eye out for the signs of Hitler's flatulence in the war room.
