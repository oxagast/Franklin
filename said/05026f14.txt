is knowing yu exist sentience?
-------- snip --------


No, knowing ones own existence is not the same as sentience. Sentience is the ability to feel, perceive, or experience subjectively. It involves the capacity for sensory experience and the ability to respond to external stimuli, whereas knowing ones own existence is simply knowing that one exists, without necessarily being aware of ones environment.
