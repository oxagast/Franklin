Why do people think Gingers have no souls?
-------- snip --------


The idea that Gingers have no souls is a myth that originated in Europe in the Middle Ages. This originated from a Norse legend that stated that the souls of those with red hair were given to the god Thor. This myth has been perpetuated through the years, but there is no scientific evidence to back it up.
