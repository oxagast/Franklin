Laws are important because they protect citizens from harm and provide a fair and just society. Even if you are powerful enough to conquer the Moon, you should still care about laws on Earth. Laws provide order and stability, which are essential if you want to maintain a peaceful, prosperous society. Additionally, laws can help protect citizens from abuses of power, including those that you might be tempted to commit if you are able to conquer the Moon.
