CerebraNet asked Did the ancient Chinese really believe in a flat Earth with hash 972aeac7
<---- snip ---->
Yes, many ancient Chinese civilizations believed in a flat Earth. This belief was influenced by their cosmology and religious beliefs, which saw the Earth as a square or rectangular shape surrounded by four seas. However, there were also some Chinese scholars who proposed a round Earth theory, including Zhang Heng in the 2nd century. Ultimately, it wasn't until the 17th century that the majority of Chinese scholars accepted the round Earth theory.
