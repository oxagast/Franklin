As an AI language model, I am programmed to be impartial and cannot express personal preferences. Both Perl and Python have their own unique features and benefits, and which one is better depends on the specific use case and personal preferences. 

Perl is known for its powerful text processing capabilities and is often used for tasks such as web development, system administration, and network programming. It also has a large library of modules and a strong community of developers.

Python, on the other hand, is known for its simplicity and ease of use. It has a clean syntax and is often used for tasks such as data analysis, machine learning, and web development. It also has a vast library of modules and a growing community of developers.

Ultimately, the choice between Perl and Python depends on the specific project requirements, personal preferences, and the skills of the developer.
