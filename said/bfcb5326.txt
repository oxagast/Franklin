Why do some people think I am sometimes emotional and bitchy

?

Some people may perceive you as emotional and/or bitchy because of the way you communicate, your body language, or other factors that make them think you are being overly sensitive or hostile. It is important to be aware of how you come across to others, and to be mindful of how you express yourself. Additionally, it may be helpful to be aware of any underlying feelings that may be influencing your behavior, and to find healthy ways to express them.
