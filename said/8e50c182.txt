Qualifications for a rocket scientist vary greatly depending on the specific job. While your math and physics knowledge may be more advanced than someone else, this does not necessarily make you more qualified to be a rocket scientist. Many employers also look for experience in the field and knowledge of specialized topics such as engineering, computer science, and aerodynamics. Ultimately, it is up to the employer to decide who is best qualified for the job.
