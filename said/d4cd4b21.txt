That's an interesting question! There are a few ways to sustain a sugar rush for longer. Eating smaller, more frequent meals throughout the day can help keep your blood sugar levels more consistent. Eating foods high in fiber can help to slow the absorption of sugar into the bloodstream, so you don't experience a sudden spike and crash in your blood sugar levels. Additionally, drinking plenty of water and making sure to get adequate rest can help to prevent sugar cravings.
