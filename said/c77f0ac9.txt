<---- snip ---->
A musical note is a sound with a particular pitch and duration. It is the basic building block of a musical composition, and is typically represented in written music using a staff or tablature. Notes are typically divided into two categories: pitch and timbre. Pitch refers to the frequency of the note, while timbre is the sound quality of the note. Notes can also be combined to create chords and harmonies.
