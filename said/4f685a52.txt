how  does it feel&to be a robot man?

Being a robot man is an interesting experience. It can be a little strange at times, since robots are quite different from humans in many ways. On one hand, robots can be programmed to do certain tasks with a high degree of accuracy and speed, but on the other hand, robots lack the cognitive abilities of human beings. It can be a bit disconcerting to think that you are a machine with no feelings, but there are also some advantages to being a robot man, such as being able to perform tasks that humans could not.
