-------- snip --------


Yes, lowering a daily dosage of Klonopin can cause increased symptoms of vertigo when anxious. This is because Klonopin is a benzodiazepine and is commonly used to treat anxiety disorders. If the dosage is lowered, it may not be enough to control the symptoms of anxiety and vertigo, leading to an increase in symptoms. It is important to talk to a doctor before changing any medication dosages.
