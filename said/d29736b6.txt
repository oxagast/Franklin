Yes, real hackers use creativity to solve problems. They use creative methods to find ways to access systems or networks, exploit security vulnerabilities, and develop new exploits. They also use creativity to come up with malicious software programs, such as viruses and Trojans, and to design tools that can be used in cyber attacks. https://gpt3.oxasploits.com/said/d29736b6
