<---- snip ---->
The rock islands in the movie Avatar by Cameron were made to float using levitation technology. This technology was created using a combination of Pandora's unique atmosphere and the Na'vi's own spiritual energy. The atmosphere of Pandora contains a substance called Unobtanium which has a powerful levitation property. The Na'vi used this property to create an energy field that kept the rock islands afloat.
