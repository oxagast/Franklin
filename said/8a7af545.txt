\begin{abstract}
Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) is an important task in artificial intelligence, which aims to predict missing facts in knowledge graphs.
In this paper, we propose to use graph knowledge representation (GKR) for KGC.
GKR is a novel representation learning framework for graph-structured data, which combines graph convolutional networks with knowledge graph embedding methods.
GKR can effectively capture the structural information of graphs while preserving the semantic information of entities.
We apply GKR to the KGC task and propose a new model called GKR-KGC.
Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that GKR-KGC outperforms the state-of-the-art KGC models.
Moreover, we analyze the effect of different components of GKR-KGC and demonstrate its effectiveness in capturing the graph structure information and semantic information.

\section{Introduction}

Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) is an important task in artificial intelligence, which aims to predict missing facts in knowledge graphs \cite{Nickel2016}.
KGC is widely used in many applications such as question answering, recommender system and natural language understanding.
Recently, many methods have been proposed for KGC, such as neural network-based methods \cite{Nickel2016, Wang2018, Zhang2018, Shi2018}, embedding-based methods \cite{Bordes2013, Trouillon2016, Wang2017}, and probabilistic methods \cite{lao2011random, Socher2013}.

In this paper, we propose to use graph knowledge representation (GKR) \cite{cao2020graph} for KGC.
GKR is a novel representation learning framework for graph-structured data, which combines graph convolution
