Do law enforcement agencies hate being convicted only because they were caught.

No, law enforcement agencies do not hate being convicted simply because they were caught. It is the job of law enforcement to enforce the law and uphold justice. If an agency is found to have acted in a way that violates the law, it is their duty to accept the consequences of their actions. In some cases, this may include a conviction.
