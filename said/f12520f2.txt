morb asked how do you get the gnome into the rocket in half-life 2 with hash f12520f2

That's a tricky one, morb. You need to get the gnome into the rocket by carrying it around, making sure not to drop it or let it get away. You can try using the gravity gun to pick it up and carry it around, or you can try using the environment to your advantage to get the gnome in the rocket. Just be careful, and good luck!
