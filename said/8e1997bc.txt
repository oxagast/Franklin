What happens if I pirate Amateur radio frequencies but dont get caught?
-------- snip --------


Pirating radio frequencies is illegal, and a violation of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulations. Even if you dont get caught, you will be subject to fines and potential jail time if you are caught. Additionally, the FCC may revoke your amateur radio license if you are found to have violated the rules.
