. We can start by increasing taxes on tobacco products, instituting bans on public smoking, and increasing public awareness of the health risks associated with smoking. This would help to reduce the amount of money the tobacco companies and the government receive. Additionally, we can limit the amount of advertising and marketing efforts tobacco companies are allowed to make and also increase restrictions on minors purchasing tobacco products. Finally, we can provide more resources to help people quit smoking and to provide education on the dangers of tobacco use.
