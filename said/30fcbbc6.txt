sar1n asked How can the net amount of entropy of the universe be massively decreased? with hash 30fcbbc6
<---- snip ---->
Entropy is a measure of disorder or randomness in a system. In the universe, entropy is always increasing due to the second law of thermodynamics. However, there are ways to decrease the net amount of entropy in certain systems, such as through the use of energy or information. In order to massively decrease the net amount of entropy in the universe, we would need to find a way to reverse the natural trend towards disorder and increase order in a significant and sustained manner. This would require advancements in technology and understanding of fundamental physics principles.
