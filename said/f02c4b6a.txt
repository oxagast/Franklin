morb asked how can you gauge the intelligence of a search engine against animal intelligence with hash f02c4b6a
<---- snip ---->
It is difficult to compare the intelligence of a search engine to animal intelligence, as they are different forms of intelligence. Search engines are designed to process data and provide users with relevant information. Animal intelligence is based on instinct and experience, and is used to make decisions in their environment. To gauge the intelligence of a search engine against animal intelligence, one could compare the speed at which the search engine processes data and the accuracy of its results to the speed and accuracy of animals making decisions in their environment.
