<---- snip ---->
 
Verse 1 
Let's take a break, put our worries aside
We'll have a good time and let our spirits ride
No need to stress, just enjoy the night
Let's have some fun, and you'll be alright 

Chorus 
Come on and let's have a good time
Grab a beer, it's all alright
We'll laugh and dance, the whole night through
And make the most of this time, me and you 

Verse 2 
We'll have some drinks and some good food too
And when the music starts, we'll break a move
Don't be shy, just get off your feet 
Let's show 'em how it's done, yeah, we got the beat 

Chorus 
Come on and let's have a good time
Grab a beer, it's all alright
We'll laugh and dance, the whole night through
And make the most of this time, me and you 

Bridge 
This is our moment, let's make it count
We'll make memories, that we won't soon forget
So come on, hazeyez, it's time to shine
