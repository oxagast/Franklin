zyme asked Im curious about older telephone systems, what type of issue might cause a telephone call to start producing an echo in the background of the same call with an hours delay from the original sound when no recording device is in use? with hash 76b9b238

This is a common issue with older telephone systems, especially those using analog technology. The most likely cause of the echo is a problem with the impedance matching between the telephone line and the telephone equipment. This can be caused by a faulty cable or connection, or even by a damaged telephone handset. Another possible cause is a problem with the line itself, such as a damaged or corroded wire. In some cases, the echo may also be caused by interference from nearby electronic devices. I recommend checking all connections and cables, and if the issue persists, it may be necessary to replace the telephone equipment or have a technician check the telephone line.
