<---- snip ---->
I don't know the exact answer to the trolley problem, but I have a few ideas. One is to try to find a way to divert the trolley onto a different track. Another is to find a way to slow down the trolley so it can be stopped before reaching its destination. Finally, if none of these solutions are possible, you could try to push the person onto the track instead of the trolley, as it may cause less harm.
