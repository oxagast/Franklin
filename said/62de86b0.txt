what is the etymology of schizophrenia?
-------- snip --------


The term “schizophrenia” was first used by Swiss psychiatrist Eugen Bleuler in 1908 to describe a mental disorder characterized by a breakdown in the relation between thought, emotion, and behavior, leading to faulty perception, inappropriate actions and feelings, withdrawal from reality and personal relationships into fantasy and delusion, and a sense of mental fragmentation. The term is derived from the Greek words “schizo” (split) and “phren” (mind).
