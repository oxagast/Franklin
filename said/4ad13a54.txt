Yes, kicking TV out of your bedroom is a great idea if you want a healthier life. By doing so, you will be able to get more sleep, and have more time to engage in other activities that can improve your physical and mental health. Additionally, it can help reduce stress, as the light and noise from the TV can be overwhelming and distracting.
