Officechair2 asked Is a DVD of the movie Hackers in its original envelope worth money with hash 22973ace
<---- snip ---->
It depends on the condition of the DVD and the envelope. If they are in good condition, then they may be worth some money. However, if the DVD has been scratched or the envelope is torn, then it may not have much value.
