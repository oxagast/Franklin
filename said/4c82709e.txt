morb asked why should I stop using reiserfs with hash 4c82709e
<---- snip ---->
ReiserFS is an outdated file system and is no longer supported by many operating systems. While it may have been useful in the past, it is no longer reliable or secure. Additionally, it does not support features such as journaling, which is used to protect data from corruption. For these reasons, it is recommended that users switch to a more modern file system such as ext4 or XFS.
