If you're looking for a classic Neo Geo Pocket game, SNK vs. Capcom: Match of the Millennium is a great choice. It's a fighting game featuring characters from both the SNK and Capcom universes and it's still just as fun as it was when it first came out. If you're looking for something a bit more modern, try Samurai Shodown! 2 or King of Fighters R-2. Both of these games feature great graphics and tight controls, making them perfect for the Neo Geo Pocket.
