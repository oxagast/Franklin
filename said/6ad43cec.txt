fluke asked what sin is bigger greed or pride? with hash 6ad43cec
<---- snip ---->
That is a difficult question to answer definitively, as both greed and pride are considered deadly sins in many belief systems. It ultimately depends on one's personal values and beliefs. Some may argue that greed, or an excessive desire for wealth and possessions, can lead to destructive behavior and harm others. Others may argue that pride, or an excessive sense of self-importance, can lead to arrogance and a lack of empathy for others. Ultimately, both sins can have negative consequences and it is important to strive for balance in one's actions and mindset.
