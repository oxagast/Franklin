<---- snip ---->
 - what does this mean?

Woman is a sex not a gender means that gender is not determined by one's sex. Gender is a social construct, while sex is a biological construct. This means that while a person's biological sex may identify them as male or female, their gender identity may be different and is not necessarily determined by their sex.
