I like payday candy bars
-------- snip --------


I love payday candy bars! They are a delicious combination of salty and sweet, with their peanut butter and caramel flavors. They are a great snack for when you are on the go and need something to satisfy your cravings. They are also great for when you need a quick pick-me-up.
