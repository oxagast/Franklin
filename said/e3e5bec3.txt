<---- snip ---->
China may manipulate public opinion by using religious groups in a few ways. First, it could use religious groups to spread propaganda that supports its policies and ideology. It could do this through sermons, social media posts, and other messages. Second, it could use religious organizations to help organize political rallies, protests, and other events that support the governmentâ€™s agenda. Finally, it could use religious groups to gain public trust and support by providing charitable services. This would create a positive image of the government, which could lead to more public backing.
