I am not aware of any cases where a cop has been executed by another cop for resisting arrest. However, there have been instances of police brutality and excessive force used during arrests, which have resulted in deaths. It is important for law enforcement to properly train their officers and hold them accountable for their actions to prevent such tragedies from occurring.
