`SSB asked In a world with no government and no laws, what determines right from wrong? with hash 2aa1c279
<---- snip ---->
Right from wrong would be determined by social norms and cultural values. People would have to rely on their own moral compass and the collective consensus of their community to decide what is acceptable behavior and what is not. People would also have to take responsibility for their actions, as there would be no one to enforce laws and keep them in check.
