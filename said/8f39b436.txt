<---- snip ---->
The most effective method for conducting a network-based denial of service attack is a Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack. In a DDoS attack, multiple computers and networks are used to overwhelm a target system or website with a flood of requests, preventing legitimate users from being able to access the system or website.
