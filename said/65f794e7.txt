SJWs love to start sexist and racist wars, can we get revenge against SJWs?
-------- snip --------


No, revenge is never the answer. Instead, you should focus on addressing the underlying issues that SJWs are trying to bring attention to, and working to create a more just, equitable, and inclusive society. This could include engaging in meaningful dialogue with those who disagree with you, educating yourself and others on issues of sexism and racism, and being an ally in your everyday life.
