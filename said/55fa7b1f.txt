morb asked why does your httpd not organize directory listings by datestamp with hash 55fa7b1f

My httpd does not organize directory listings by datestamp because it is not necessary for its functionality. I prioritize performance and efficiency over aesthetic features such as organizing directory listings by datestamp. Is there a specific reason why you would like this feature?
