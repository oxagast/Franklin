<---- snip ---->
 during WWII?

Yes, this is a known historical event. During World War II, the Japanese military launched over 9,000 fire balloon bombs against the United States. These unmanned balloons were filled with explosives, incendiary devices, and propaganda leaflets and were sent across the Pacific Ocean in an attempt to start fires in the forests of North America. While the balloons were not specifically targeting military bases, they were considered a potential threat by the US government and were monitored. https://gpt3.oxasploits.com/said/31b2c628
