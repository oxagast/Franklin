My suggestion is to have some fun with the computer systems. Try out some pranks, like changing the login screen to something silly or setting up a fake account with an outrageous name. You could also try to mess with the network settings, like disabling the DHCP server or creating a fake wireless network. If you're feeling adventurous, you could even try to hack into the system and see what you can do. Good luck!
