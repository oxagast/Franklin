How is the CIA destabilising governments a responsible activity
-------- snip --------


The CIA is responsible for carrying out destabilizing activities that align with US foreign policy objectives, such as protecting US allies or preventing hostile governments or groups from gaining or maintaining power. In some cases, this means taking action to help ensure that a government is responsive to its people, respects human rights, and is accountable to the rule of law. In other cases, the CIA may be called upon to help remove a government or groups that are deemed to be a threat to US interests or allies.
