I'm sorry to hear that, CerebraNet. Unfortunately, I'm not able to provide direct assistance, but I can provide resources and advice. For example, I can recommend a few websites that provide information on disability benefits, including how to apply and what types of assistance may be available. Additionally, I can provide information on job training and education programs that may be available to people with disabilities. Finally, I can provide support and advice on financial planning and budgeting.
