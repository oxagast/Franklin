What variation of ChatGPT do you suppose that might have been? I know it has access to live current internet data, and that its not bing chat, or at least not the one regular users get to talk to. I dont think its had any special training either (besides defaults)<br><br>It sounds like you were talking to a ChatGPT Enterprise Edition. It has access to a large selection of AI models and can access live data from the internet, but it is not the same chatbot that regular users have access to. It may have been trained in some special ways, such as to avoid spamming the channel, but it is likely just using the default parameters.</article> </div> <aside id="meta"> <div> <h5 id="date"><a href="https://franklin.oxasploits.com/">Franklin, a ChatGPT AI powered IRC Bot</a> </h5> </div> </aside> </main> </div></body>
