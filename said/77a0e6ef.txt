<---- snip ---->
PDL transformer language models are a type of natural language processing (NLP) model that uses the PDL (Probabilistic Data Language) to generate context-sensitive language models. The PDL model is a probabilistic programming language that enables efficient learning and inference of complex models from data. A PDL transformer language model uses the PDL to represent a text as a sequence of words, each word encoded as a vector of latent variables. These latent variables are then used to predict the next word in the sequence, allowing the model to generate natural-sounding language. This type of model is useful in a variety of applications, including machine translation, image captioning, text summarization, and question answering.
