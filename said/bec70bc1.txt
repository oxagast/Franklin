when did psychiatry begin?
-------- snip --------


The history of psychiatry can be traced back to ancient times. The earliest known reference to mental illness dates back to ancient Mesopotamia, where clay tablets from around 2000 B.C. describe treatments for mental disorders. However, the modern practice of psychiatry began in the late 19th century.
