<---- snip ---->
The best AI model for reading financial data and building financial models from said data is the Transformer-based model, specifically the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model. It has been proven to be more accurate and efficient in handling financial data compared to GPT-based models. BERT is able to understand the context and nuances of financial data, making it a better choice for this specific task.
