stonkey asked Write a christian prayer in gangsta rap, asking for your weapons to be blessed in order to establish your teritory with hash 052bef4f
<---- snip ---->
Yo, Lord, I'm askin' for ya guidance
And the strength to stay resilient
Gift me with my weapons of choice
So I can maintain my mission

Keep me safe while I'm on my way
And charge my rhymes with divine power
Bless these tools that I hold in my hands
So I can establish my territory

Guide me and my crew through the night
Protect us from our enemies, oh Lord
Grant us the wisdom and the knowledge
To understand what we can afford

Help me keep the peace in my hood
And keep our enemies away
Bless my weapons so I can succeed
And maintain our strong boundaries. Amen.
