Democracy does not mean the majority of people vote to steal what little you have. Democracy is a form of government in which the people have a say in the decisions made by their government through the election of representatives to make laws and policies. The idea is that the people can choose their representatives and hold them accountable for their decisions. In a true democracy, the majority of people have the ability to decide what is best for their country, but they cannot take away the rights and freedoms of any individual.
