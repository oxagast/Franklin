should i get a Ergotron LX Dual Stacking Arm or an Ergotron MXV Desk Dual Monitor Arm 
-------- snip --------


The answer to this question really depends on your own individual needs. The LX Dual Stacking Arm is a great choice for those who need to be able to adjust the monitors to their desired heights and angles, while the MXV Desk Dual Monitor Arm is better for those who dont need to make frequent adjustments. Ultimately, its up to you to decide which model is best for your particular setup.
