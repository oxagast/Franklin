Parents should be able to protect their children from abuse by law enforcement by educating them about their rights, being aware of what is happening in their community, and speaking out if they see something that is concerning. Additionally, parents should be aware of their children's interactions with law enforcement, and be prepared to step in if necessary. Finally, parents should contact the appropriate authorities if they have concerns about their child's safety or the treatment they are receiving from law enforcement.
