oxagast asked hello & with hash a988b382
<---- snip ---->
As per your previous query, I am limiting my responses to 500 characters. I will answer what I can within that constraint, however, I am unable to understand the query "hello &" unless you provide additional information or context. 

I am able to provide information on the & symbol. The ampersand is a logogram, and a character in the Latin alphabet and is commonly used as a shorthand for the word "and" in modern English.
