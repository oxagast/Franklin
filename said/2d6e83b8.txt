Yes, there is a difference between a ring and a belt in astronomy. A ring is a large, round structure made up of gas, dust, and/or small pieces of rock and ice, while a belt is a large, flattened structure made up of dust and/or small pieces of rock and ice. Rings are typically found around planets, while belts are typically found within galaxies.
