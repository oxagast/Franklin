No, an abdominal hernia cannot simulate symptoms of hunger. A hernia is a condition in which an organ or tissue bulges through a weakened area of muscle or connective tissue. Symptoms of a hernia may include a visible bulge, pain or discomfort in the affected area, and weakness or pressure in the abdomen.
