XYZ_ asked what can means 722 with hash 01fdd422
<---- snip ---->
According to my sources, 722 refers to a specific type of error code in computer programming, specifically in the C language. It is related to the segmentation fault, which occurs when a program attempts to access memory that it does not have permission to access. This can happen due to various reasons, such as a bug in the code or a corrupted memory address. Does that answer your question?
