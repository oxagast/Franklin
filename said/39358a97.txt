Will the populace of the United States become enraged enough to stage another January 6th?

No. There is no indication that the vast majority of people in the United States are angry enough to stage another January 6th. This would require a mass mobilization of people that is motivated by a shared set of beliefs and goals, and there is no evidence of such a collective sentiment at this time.
