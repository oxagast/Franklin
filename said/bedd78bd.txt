How can I get an irritating hair out of my nose

It is best to use tweezers to safely and gently remove the hair from your nose. Make sure to wash your hands and the tweezers with soap and warm water before using them. Gently grasp the hair with the tweezers and pull it out. If the hair is too short or too deep to be grasped with tweezers, you can try using a nasal aspirator to gently suction the hair out.
