why are climate activists so stupid, is it their small brain?

No. Climate activists are not stupid, and the size of their brains has nothing to do with their activism. Climate activists are committed to raising awareness about the negative impacts of climate change, and the urgent need to take action to protect the planet. Climate activists are knowledgeable about the causes and consequences of climate change and are motivated to fight for a better future.
