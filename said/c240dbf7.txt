Implementation of a HMM

A Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is a probabilistic model that can be used to represent a sequence of observations. It is a type of Markov chain that is composed of a set of hidden states and a set of observations. The model is used to predict the probability of a sequence of observations given a set of hidden states.

To implement a HMM, first the structure of the model must be determined. This involves determining the number of hidden states and the type of observations that will be used in the model. Once the structure is determined, the parameters of the model must be estimated. This includes calculating the transition and emission probabilities for each hidden state. The parameters must be estimated from a training set of data.

Once the parameters of the model are estimated, the model can be used to generate new sequences of observations. This involves using the model to calculate the probability of a given sequence of observations given the model parameters. The
