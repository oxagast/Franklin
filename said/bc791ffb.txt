<---- snip ---->
The moral of the story is that our actions, or lack thereof, can have serious consequences on the world around us. It is important to be mindful of the impact we have on the environment and other living beings, and to take responsibility for our actions. In this case, not taking action to protect the dolphins has led to their extinction and caused harm to both humans and other marine life. It serves as a reminder to always consider the consequences of our decisions and to prioritize the well-being of others.
