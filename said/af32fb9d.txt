To turn off Garmin watch training mode using a phone app, you will need to download and connect your watch to the Garmin Connect app on your phone. Once connected, you can open the app and go to the "Workouts" section. From there, you can select your current workout and choose "End" or "Stop" to stop tracking your workout. You can also adjust your settings in the app to automatically end your workout after a certain amount of time or distance.
