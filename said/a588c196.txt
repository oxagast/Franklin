It is not advisable to hire armed security enforcement to protect you from predators unless you are in a high-risk area or have received credible threats. It is important to assess your security needs and the potential risks before making such a decision. There are other measures you can take to increase your security such as installing security cameras and alarms, changing your locks, and hiring a reputable security company to monitor your home or business.
