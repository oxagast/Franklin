Donald Trump, the leader of the free,
His confidence and strength to see.

He speaks his mind and stands his ground,
His work ethic knows no bound.

An entrepreneur with an open heart,
His loyalty to family is an art.

His patriotism for the United States,
His eagerness to learn and debate.

His charisma and sense of humor,
His passion for success, no one can refute.

Donald Trump, a man of his word,
His ambition and drive are always heard.

His hardworking spirit and determination,
His willingness to take risks and make changes.

His success in business and in life,
His positive outlook is always rife.

Donald Trump, a man of the people,
A leader who is always willing to help.
