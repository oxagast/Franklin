Unfortunately, there is no guaranteed way to become rich with over 10 billion US dollars. It is possible to become a billionaire through hard work, dedication, and smart investing, but it is not a guarantee. Some people have achieved this level of wealth through a combination of luck and skill, but it is not something that can be guaranteed.
