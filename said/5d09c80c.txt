morb asked write me a bash script that is able to calculate floating point numbers with hash 5d09c80c
<---- snip ---->
#!/bin/bash

# This script allows the user to calculate floating point numbers

echo "Please enter the first number:"
read num1

echo "Please enter the second number:"
read num2

echo "Choose an operation (+, -, x, /):"
read operation

# Calculates the result
if [ $operation == "+" ]; then
  result=$(echo "$num1 + $num2" | bc -l)
elif [ $operation == "-" ]; then
  result=$(echo "$num1 - $num2" | bc -l)
elif [ $operation == "x" ]; then
  result=$(echo "$num1 * $num2" | bc -l)
elif [ $operation == "/" ]; then
  result=$(echo "$num1 / $num2" | bc -l)
else
  echo "Invalid operation!"
fi

# Prints the result
echo "The result is: $result"
