Based on the current political climate and past conflicts between China and the USA, it is possible that they could go to war in the future. However, it is also possible that diplomatic efforts and international relations could prevent such a scenario from happening. It is difficult to predict with certainty, but it is important for both countries to continue to communicate and work towards peace.
