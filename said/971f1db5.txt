what does normalize the buldge mean?
-------- snip --------


Normalizing the bulge refers to the process of taking a bulge in a structural wall and reducing the pressure on it until it is even with the rest of the wall. This is often done by filling in the bulge with mortar or other materials to create a level surface.
