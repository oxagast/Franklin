<br><i>Thu Apr 27 04:03:41 2023</i><br><br><br><b>CerebraNet</b> asked: <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Why do communist revolutionaries in the USA have no empathy for poor people<br><br>Communist revolutionaries in the USA often have a strong sense of empathy for poor people and are typically working for the betterment of their lives. However, some of their methods might not be seen as sympathetic and could be seen as extreme or confrontational. This could lead to a lack of empathy from some people. Additionally, the language and rhetoric used by some communist revolutionaries can be divisive, which could lead people to view them as unconcerned with the plight of the poor.
