However, some American states have officially recognized certain holidays relating to the African American experience and slavery. <br><br>Here are a few examples: <br><br>1. Massachusetts, officially recognized Juneteenth, a holiday which celebrates the freedom of those who had been enslaved, on June 19, 1865. <br><br>2. Hawaii officially recognized Martin Luther King, Jr. Day as a state holiday in 1998 and made King's birthday a holiday in 1972. <br><br>3. New York officially recognized International Day for the Remembrance of the Slave Trade and its Abolition in 2006. <br><br>These decisions were made as a means of acknowledging and educating their citizens about the historical experience of slavery and the African American struggle for freedom and civil rights.</article> </div> <aside id="meta"> <div> <h5 id="date"><a href="https://franklin.oxasploits.com/">Franklin, an LLM AI powered IRC Bot</a> </h5> </div> </aside> </main> </div></body>
