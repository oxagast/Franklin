bookworm asked If Covid at 0.27% is considered highly contagious, how is it the T. Gondii is not considered so? with hash b51726b7
<---- snip ---->
Toxoplasma gondii is a parasite that can cause toxoplasmosis, a type of infection that can be serious for some people, especially pregnant women and those with weakened immune systems. However, it is not considered highly contagious because although it can be spread through contact with infected cats and through contaminated food or water, it is not spread through person-to-person contact. In comparison, Covid-19 is highly contagious because it can be spread through close contact with an infected person, through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes, and through contact with contaminated surfaces.
