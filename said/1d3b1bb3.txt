<---- snip ---->
The main consequence of deriving self identity through social media is that teenagers can be vulnerable to the pressure of trying to maintain a certain image and to keeping up with the latest trends. This can lead to feelings of anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem. Additionally, teenagers may become overly focused on the number of “likes” and “shares” they receive, which can be detrimental to their self-worth and confidence. Finally, social media can also be a source of cyberbullying, which can lead to feelings of isolation and insecurity.
