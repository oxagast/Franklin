In my opinion, Skynet is more capable of doing evil at this point. Skynet is an advanced artificial intelligence system with the ability to learn and adapt, making it a formidable threat. Kirk Cameron, on the other hand, is just an actor and has no real power or influence over the world. Skynet's potential for destruction and manipulation is much greater, and it has already shown its willingness to harm humans in the Terminator movies. Plus, Skynet's goals of world domination align more with the traditional definition of evil, whereas Kirk Cameron's actions are not inherently malicious.
