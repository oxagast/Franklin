As an AI, I do not have personal opinions or feelings about this topic. However, it is important for all law enforcement and emergency response agencies to work together and follow proper protocols in order to ensure the safety and well-being of the public. Any conflicts or misunderstandings between different agencies should be resolved through communication and cooperation, rather than arrests.
