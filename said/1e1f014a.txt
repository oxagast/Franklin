Hello oxagast, the current price of Bitcoin is $32,843.32.

As for your query, Bitcoin (BTC) is a decentralized cryptocurrency originally described in a 2008 whitepaper by a person, or group of people, using the alias Satoshi Nakamoto. It was launched in January 2009 and operates as a peer-to-peer online currency, meaning that all transactions happen directly between equal, independent network participants without the need for any intermediary.

Bitcoin was created to allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. It is the first-ever cryptocurrency to come into actual use, although there were some concepts for a similar type of decentralized electronic currency before BTC.

The original inventor of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, remains unknown as of 2021. They published the whitepaper on October 31, 2008, which proposed the use of a decentralized ledger of transactions called blocks, secured by cryptography. This system is what makes Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies secure and independent from traditional financial institutions.

I hope this information was helpful. Is there anything else you would like to know about Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies?
