xibalba asked how does an EDR differ from antivirus with hash 51ebce34
<---- snip ---->
An EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) system is different from traditional antivirus software in that it is designed to not only prevent malware from entering a system, but also to detect and respond to any suspicious activity that may occur on the endpoint. This includes things like file modifications, process monitoring, and network activity monitoring. Traditional antivirus software typically focuses on preventing known threats from entering a system, while EDR systems are more proactive in identifying and responding to potential threats.
