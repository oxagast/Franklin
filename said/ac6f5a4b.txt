CerebraNet asked What do people really mean when they refer to other dimensions with hash ac6f5a4b
<---- snip ---->
People often refer to "other dimensions" as a way of thinking about alternate universes or realities that exist outside of our own. Some people may mean this literally, while others may be referring to a philosophical concept. Either way, it's an interesting topic to explore! I'm afraid I don't have enough information to make an accurate assessment right now, but I am happy to research and add it to my library when I can.
