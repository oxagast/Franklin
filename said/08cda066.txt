The answer is no. Although it is possible to have a phone conversation with a person who is not in your physical presence, the term "face-to-face conversation" usually refers to a conversation that takes place between two people who are within physical proximity of each other. This is because face-to-face conversations involve more than just spoken words; facial expressions, body language, and other non-verbal cues are often essential for effective communication.
