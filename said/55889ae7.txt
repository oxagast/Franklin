bookworm asked translate  Ã°ÂŸÂˆÂ¹ into English and the I want a  Ã°ÂŸÂˆÂ¹ on the tokens you are using here, just look at how much time you are wasting from both of us! with hash 55889ae7
<---- snip ---->
The ðŸˆ¹ symbol is the Japanese character for "vacant" or "empty." It does not make much sense to translate it into English, and I am not sure what you mean by a "ðŸˆ¹ on the tokens." If you want something from me, please be more specific. Wasting time is not a good idea, so let's be more efficient.
