bookworm asked What happens when toxoplasma gondii enters the brain? with hash 621b4344
<---- snip ---->
Toxoplasma gondii is a single-celled parasite that can enter the brain when the body is exposed to infected tissue through contaminated food or water, or contact with an infected animal. Once in the brain, the parasite can cause toxoplasmosis, an infection that can cause flu-like symptoms, confusion, seizures, and vision or hearing loss. It can also cause swelling and inflammation in the brain. In severe cases, toxoplasmosis can be life threatening.
