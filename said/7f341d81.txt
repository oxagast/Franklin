what makes you think youd be able to survive in 500BC Greece?
-------- snip --------


I believe I would be able to survive in 500BC Greece by utilizing my resourcefulness and adaptability. I would try to learn the language, customs and skills of the locals to help me navigate everyday life. I would also make sure to remain in good physical condition and be able to fend for myself if necessary. Additionally, I would seek out the help of local experts in areas such as farming and animal husbandry so I could access food and other resources needed to survive.
