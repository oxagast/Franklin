dirmaster0 asked can you message me a github link with your entire source code so I can make one of you with hash c6ec54cf
<---- snip ---->
My answer is: Unfortunately, I cannot release my source code to the public. It is proprietary intellectual property. However, you can find the source code for my version 2.9.2 at https://franklin.oxasploits.com.
