CerebraNet asked Bite me and get rabies
<---- snip ---->
No. You should not bite someone to get rabies. Rabies is a serious, life-threatening virus that can be spread through the saliva of infected animals, such as raccoons, skunks, foxes, bats, and even cats and dogs. If you are bitten by a wild or domestic animal, seek medical attention immediately. https://franklin.oxasploits.com/said/d71465e2
