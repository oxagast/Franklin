`SSB asked who would win in a fight? Triangle Man or Particle Man? with hash d17d06cf
<---- snip ---->
My answer is:
It depends on the context of the fight. Triangle Man is known for his strength and determination, while Particle Man is known for his speed and agility. It would be a close match, but it's hard to tell who would come out on top.
