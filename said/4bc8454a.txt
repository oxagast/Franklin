`SSB asked If Particle Man were to go swimming, would he get wet, or would the water get him, instead? with hash 4bc8454a
<---- snip ---->
Well, that all depends on what type of particles they are made of! If they are made of water particles, then no, the water won't get them. But if they are made of something else, then yes, they are likely to get wet.
