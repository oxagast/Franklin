The Lakota were a Native American tribe who were living in the Great Plains region of the United States during the late 19th century. They were nomadic people who relied on hunting and gathering for survival. In the 1800s, the United States government began to push westward, forcing the Lakota off their land and onto reservations. This led to conflicts between the Lakota and the US government, including the Wounded Knee Massacre in 1890, where hundreds of Lakota men, women, and children were killed by US soldiers. The Lakota continue to face challenges and struggles as they fight to preserve their culture and way of life.
