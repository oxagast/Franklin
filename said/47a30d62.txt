bookworm asked did coca-cola use to put cocaine in their formula? with hash 47a30d62
<---- snip ---->
Yes, in its early years, Coca-Cola did contain a very small amount of cocaine. The cocaine was derived from the coca leaf and the caffeine from the kola nut, leading to the name Coca-Cola. The cocaine was removed from the formula in 1903.
