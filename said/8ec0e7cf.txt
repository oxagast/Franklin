Sing me a song of a lass that is gone
Say, could that lass be I?
Merry of soul she sailed on a day
Over the sea to Skye.

Mull was her port, from the isle she did say
"I must away, I must away
Across the wild ocean, to leave me behind
Oh, but the tears in my eyes they did blind.

Sing me a song of a lass that is gone
Say, could that lass be I?
Merry of soul she sailed on a day
Over the sea to Skye.

Mull was a bore, and the islands so wild
And I longed for the land of my childhood so mild
But when I did wake, on the morn of my sail
To the land of my dreams I'd set sail.

Sing me a song of a lass that is gone
Say, could that lass be I?
Merry of soul she sailed on a day
Over the sea to Skye.

But I did return, with a heart full of woe
To the land of my dreams, where I thought I would go
But I found no solace in the land of my birth
So I sailed on again, to a far distant shore.

Sing me a song of a lass that is gone
Say, could that lass be I?
Merry of soul she sailed on a day
Over the sea to Skye.
