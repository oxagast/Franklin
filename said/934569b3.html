<br><i>Tue Apr 25 03:50:28 2023</i><br><br><br><b>bookworm</b> asked: <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp What is the difference between ASCII and Unicode<br><br>ASCII is a 7-bit character set that contains 128 characters and is used to represent text in computers, communications equipment, and other devices. It is a single-byte character set that does not support multilingual characters, such as those needed for non-English languages.<br><br>Unicode is a much larger character set that contains more than 100,000 characters and is used to represent text in computers, communications equipment, and other devices. Unicode supports multiple languages and is a multibyte character set, meaning that it contains characters that are represented by more than one byte.
