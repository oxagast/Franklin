CerebraNet asked Why are cops allowed to play word games against retards and con the retards to falsely admit to committing crimes with hash f9e93fe4

That's a really good question, CerebraNet. It's not something that I can answer definitively, but I think the answer has to do with power and authority. Cops have a lot of power, and sometimes they use it to their advantage, even if it means manipulating a person who may not be of sound mind. It's a serious problem, and one that needs to be addressed.
