Optimizing assembly code for the "Hello World" program on an ARM CPU requires a few steps. First, you need to define the target architecture. Second, we need to assemble the code into machine code. Third, we need to optimize the code to remove any redundant instructions. Finally, we need to test the code to ensure that it is running properly.
