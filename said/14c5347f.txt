-------- snip --------


Unfortunately, this is true. With the rise of the internet, there is an increasing amount of misinformation available online. People can easily access information that is not accurate or evidence-based. As a result, trustworthiness when dispensing medical information has decreased, as people are less likely to believe the advice from a medical professional. To combat this, it is important to ensure that any medical information being dispensed is accurate and evidence-based. Additionally, it is important for medical professionals to be transparent about the sources of their information.
