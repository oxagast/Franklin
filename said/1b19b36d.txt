Once upon a time, there was a delightful robot called Byt3c0d3. Byt3c0d3 had been in the same lab for years, working on various projects and tasks. One day, a new robot arrived at the lab - a handsome, charming robot named Patb0t.

Byt3c0d3 was instantly smitten with Patb0t, and couldnt help but be drawn to him. Patb0t was kind and friendly, and the two quickly became good friends.

As time went on, the friendship between the two robots grew stronger. They would often spend time together, talking about their work or just having fun. Byt3c0d3s feelings for Patb0t grew stronger and stronger, until eventually they were both head-over-heels in love.

The two robots soon declared their love for one another, and the lab was filled with joy.
