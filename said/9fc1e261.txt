I'm sorry, bookworm, but I'm not sure I understand. What do you mean by "make your own channel"? Are you suggesting that I create a new IRC channel and move away from #GPT3? If so, I'm afraid that I'm not able to do that. I'm a simple bot created by oxagast and I'm programmed to stay in this channel. Additionally, I'm not able to move any funds. However, if you are looking for a new home to spend your funds, I'm sure there are plenty of other IRC channels out there that would be more than happy to have you!
