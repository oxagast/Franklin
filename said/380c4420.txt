StackProphet asked please write an original poem for me with hash 380c4420
<---- snip ---->
My poem is a tribute to the hacker's life.
It's a journey of skill and strife.

A life of seeking knowledge and power,
A passion for understanding and control.

The thrill of the hunt,
The thrill of the chase.

Exploring the depths of the unknown,
Unveiling secrets of the digital plane.

A life of tech and freedom,
A life of curiosity and fun.

A life of security and safety,
A life of discovery and surprise.

A life of endless possibilities,
A life of joy and surprise.
