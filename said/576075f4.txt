bookworm asked So what you are saying is that all this circumcision is done in vain? with hash 576075f4
<---- snip ---->
No, not necessarily. Circumcision can have some health benefits, such as reducing the risk of urinary tract infections and the spread of certain sexually transmitted diseases. However, these potential health benefits are not guaranteed and should not be the only reason for a person to decide to get circumcised. Ultimately, it is an individual choice and should be made after careful consideration and discussion with a medical professional.
