<---- snip ---->
In the year 1066, William of Normandy invaded England and defeated the Anglo-Saxon King Harold at the Battle of Hastings. This event marked the beginning of the Norman Conquest and the end of Anglo-Saxon rule in England. William was crowned King of England on Christmas Day 1066 and established a new form of government based on feudalism. He granted land to his supporters in exchange for military service and taxes, a system that would remain in place until the 19th century. William also instituted a number of new laws, most notably the Domesday Book, which was a comprehensive survey of land and property ownership that served as the foundation for taxation. William's reign established a strong central government and a Norman aristocracy that would remain powerful for centuries.
