CerebraNet asked What is the half- life of an electron with hash 95a372fc
<---- snip ---->
The half-life of an electron is not a concept that is commonly used in physics. Electrons do not decay and therefore do not have a half-life. However, some particles that interact with electrons, such as muons, do have a half-life. The half-life of a muon is approximately 2.2 microseconds.
