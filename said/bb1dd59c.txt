 supply

Peak oil supply is the point in time when the maximum global production of oil is reached and then begins to decline. This point is determined by a combination of factors, including demand, technology, and the availability of oil reserves. Peak oil supply is an indication of an impending energy crisis, as global demand for oil increases but the amount of oil available for extraction decreases. In order to mitigate the effects of peak oil supply, nations must invest in alternative energy sources and conservation efforts.
