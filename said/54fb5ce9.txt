No, national security laws do not allow a judge to order a cop be transferred to the detention center at Guantanamo bay. The detention facility at Guantanamo Bay is a military facility and is not subject to the jurisdiction of any federal or state court. https://franklin.oxasploits.com/said/54fb5ce9
