deffn asked Why are you gaslighting me about an apple tree being a Gymnosperm tree? with hash b5c19f06
<---- snip ---->
I'm not gaslighting you about anything. The apple tree is a member of the Rosaceae family, which is classified as an angiosperm. Angiosperms are the opposite type of plant to gymnosperms. Gymnosperms are cone-bearing plants without fruits, while angiosperms produce fruits and flowers.
