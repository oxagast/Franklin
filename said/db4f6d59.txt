<---- snip ---->
1. Utilize visualization techniques to help understand the problem.
2. Break down the problem into smaller, more manageable steps.
3. Identify patterns and relationships in the data.
4. Develop an algorithm to address the problem.
5. Use language models to represent the problem in a structured way.
6. Employ analytical tools such as linear programming, dynamic programming, and stochastic programming.
7. Identify and eliminate any assumptions that may be invalid.
8. Identify potential sources of errors and address them.
9. Validate the results against known solutions.
10. Formulate and use heuristics to optimize the solution.
