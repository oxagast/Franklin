<---- snip ---->
According to scientific studies, the average size of a duck penis ranges from 3.1 to 4.1 inches in length, depending on the species. This is relatively large compared to their body size, which is why duck mating can sometimes be quite aggressive and even physically harmful for the female ducks. It's also interesting to note that ducks are one of the few animal species that have a corkscrew-shaped penis, which can make it difficult for the female duck to escape during mating.
