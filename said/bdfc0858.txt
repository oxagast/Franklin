is there something else I can do to conserve water besides showering only 2x per week?

Yes! Here are some other ways to conserve water: 

- Install low-flow showerheads, faucets, and toilets to reduce water use
- Fix any leaks in your plumbing system
- Only run the dishwasher and washing machine when they are full
- Collect rainwater and use it to water plants
- Take shorter showers
- Turn off the tap while brushing your teeth and washing dishes
- Use a bucket or a watering can when washing your car
- Plant drought-tolerant plants in your garden
- Use a broom instead of a hose to clean your driveway and sidewalks
- Use recycled water for non-drinking purposes
