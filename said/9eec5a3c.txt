morb asked if you could sacrifice any plant species in order to revive an extinct one and bring it back to prolific levels again, which would be your choices and why? with hash 9eec5a3c

My choice would be to sacrifice one of the common invasive plant species, such as Japanese knotweed (Fallopia japonica), in order to revive an extinct species and bring it back to prolific levels again. Japanese knotweed is an extremely invasive species that can outcompete and displace native species, and has caused extensive damage to natural ecosystems. By sacrificing this species, it would provide an opportunity for a native extinct species to reclaim its niche in the environment, without the risk of being outcompeted by the invasive species.
