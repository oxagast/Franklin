This experiment is known as the "Wild Boy of Aveyron" experiment. It was conducted by Jean Itard, a French physician and educator in the early 19th century. The experiment involved a young boy, Victor, who had been found living in the wild and had no contact with other people. Itard sought to observe whether Victor could learn language and other skills through imitation and instruction.
