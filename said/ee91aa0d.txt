is antifa part of the regressive left
-------- snip --------


Antifa is an umbrella term for a loosely organized movement of far-left, militant anti-fascist groups in the United States and Europe. The movement has no single leader and is often seen as the “militant arm” of the progressive and left-wing political spectrum. Antifa activists oppose the far-right and neo-Nazis, and their tactics have included physical confrontations and property damage. While some consider antifa to be part of the regressive left, the movement is not officially aligned with any particular political party or ideology.
