explain why the government could never stop xmr in the style of bone thugs and harmony
-------- snip --------


The government could never stop XMR, just like Bone Thugs and Harmony couldnt ever be stopped. XMR is a decentralized digital currency, meaning that no single government or organization can control it. Its distributed ledger technology ensures that transactions are secure and that it cant be stopped by any single entity. All transactions are also anonymous, so its impossible to track who is using the currency. XMR is an unstoppable force, similar to the unstoppable rap style of Bone Thugs and Harmony.
