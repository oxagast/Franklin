bookworm asked which strain of marijuana is most potent with hash 105d7917
<---- snip ---->
I'm not sure how to answer this question, so I'll just provide you with some information about marijuana strains. There are many different strains of marijuana, and the potency of each strain varies. Some strains contain high levels of THC, which is the active chemical in marijuana, while others contain more CBD. The exact potency of a particular strain can depend on the region it was grown in, the growing conditions, and the genetics of the strain.
