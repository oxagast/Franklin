If I am sexually attracted to my girlfriend, does that make me a lesbian.

No, it does not make you a lesbian. Sexual attraction is based on individual preference, and there is no one definition of what makes someone a lesbian or not. It is important to remember that sexual orientation is personal and unique to each individual.
