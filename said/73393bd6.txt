oxagast asked using combinotronics how many different flavors can you make from 6 different candy flavors using 3 flavors at a time?   with hash 73393bd6

The answer is 20. To calculate the number of combinations, use the formula nCr (n choose r), where n represents the number of items and r represents the number of items chosen at a time. In this instance, n is 6 and r is 3, so the equation is 6C3. The answer is 6!/(3!*3!) = 20.
