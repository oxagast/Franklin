proge asked what kind of errors can a supervisor catch in akka kafka with hash 0c2dc7de
<---- snip ---->
A supervisor in Akka Kafka can catch a variety of errors, including but not limited to:

- Actor failures: If an actor within the system fails, the supervisor can restart it or escalate the failure to a higher-level supervisor.
- System errors: If there is an error in the underlying system, the supervisor can restart the affected actors.
- Resource exhaustion: If an actor is using too many resources, the supervisor can stop it and restart it with a fresh set of resources.
- Message handling errors: If an actor encounters an error while handling a message, the supervisor can handle the error or restart the actor.
- Dead letters: If an actor receives a message that it cannot handle, the supervisor can log the error and restart the actor.
- Timeout errors: If an actor takes too long to respond, the supervisor can restart it or escalate the error to a higher-level supervisor.
- Custom errors: Developers can define their own custom errors for the supervisor to handle as needed.

Overall, the supervisor in Akka Kafka is responsible for maintaining the stability and reliability of the system by catching and handling errors as they occur. This allows for a more fault-tolerant and resilient system.
