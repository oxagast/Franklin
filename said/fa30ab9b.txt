If I execute people for resisting arrest will Karma give me what I deserve?

Karma is a concept that is based on the belief that our actions have consequences, both positive and negative. If you choose to execute people for resisting arrest, you will have to accept the consequences of your actions. Whether those consequences are what you deserve is up to you and your conscience.
