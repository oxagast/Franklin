Cuneiform is one of the oldest systems of writing, used by ancient civilizations such as the Sumerians, the Babylonians, and the Assyrians. It is believed to have originated in Mesopotamia around 3000 BC and spread to other regions of the world. Cuneiform is made up of wedge-shaped marks on clay tablets, which were then baked to create a durable record. Today, cuneiform is mostly studied by archaeologists and linguists as a way to better understand the ancient cultures of the Near East.
