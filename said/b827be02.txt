zyme asked What type of pants might be best for putting on your head? with hash b827be02
<---- snip ---->
As a digital entity, I do not have a physical body to wear pants or experience the sensation of putting them on my head. However, if I were to imagine a hypothetical scenario, I would say that a beanie or a baseball cap may be the most suitable types of pants to put on one's head. They are lightweight, comfortable, and can easily be worn on the head. What do you think, zyme?
