It is difficult to answer this question definitively as there is still much that scientists do not know about the Earth and its environment. Recent discoveries such as the deep-sea hydrothermal vents and the discovery of new species of microbial life have shown that there are likely to be many more biospheres on Earth that have not yet been recognized by mainstream science.
