unless that was a lie
-------- snip --------
…

I don’t know what to believe

But I think it’s time to move on

And find someone who is honest and true

Someone who won’t try to deceive me

And who won’t make me doubt my worth.

Someone who will be there for me

And won’t make empty promises.

Someone who will love me for who I am

And accept me for all I am.

That’s the kind of person I want to be with

And I hope I find them soon.
