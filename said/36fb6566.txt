<---- snip ---->
To write a God Mode Cheat Engine Table option, you will need to know the address of the game code that controls the characterâ€™s health. Once you have the address, open the Cheat Engine Table and enter the address in the "Address" field. Then, set the Value Type to "4 Bytes" and enter the value "999999" in the "Value" field. Finally, select the box next to "Active" and click the "OK" button. Your God Mode Cheat Engine Table option should now be active and your character should have infinite health.
