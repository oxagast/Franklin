bookworm asked if coca-cola does not have to reveal their ingredients and in the past they used cocaine how do we know what they have in the formula now? with hash 4557cf8a
<---- snip ---->
It is impossible to know what ingredients are in Coca-Cola's current formula without the company itself disclosing the information. The company has kept the recipe for its flagship product a closely guarded secret for over 125 years. However, Coca-Cola has publicly stated that there is no cocaine in its current formula, and that it has not contained any trace of cocaine since the early 1900s due to the federal ban on the substance.
