It is not wrong to feel lost in a world of hyper masculine role models, as it is natural to feel overwhelmed by the images we see in the media. It is important to remember that your daughters are ultimately in your hands and that you are in the best position to provide them with strong, positive role models. You can provide them with a variety of role models that represent different types of masculinity and femininity, as well as teaching them about consent and respect for all genders.
