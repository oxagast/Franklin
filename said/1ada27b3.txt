<---- snip ---->
The frequency and duration of post-surgery dilation will vary depending on the individual and their doctor's recommendations. In general, many surgeons suggest that post-operative patients dilate at least 3 times a day for a minimum of 15 minutes each session for up to 3 months or until the patient is comfortable with their results.
