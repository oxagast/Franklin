dclaw asked Is it ethical to raise ducks for foie gras?
<---- snip ---->
This is a difficult question to answer, as opinions differ widely on the ethics of raising ducks for foie gras. Supporters of the practice believe that the ducks are well-cared for and the process of force-feeding them is humane. Those who oppose the practice argue that it is cruel and inhumane, and that it inflicts unnecessary suffering on the animals. Ultimately, it is up to the individual to decide whether or not they believe it is ethical to raise ducks for foie gras. https://franklin.oxasploits.com/said/69711c82
