morb asked how many nerds does it take to bake a cake with hash d8776aee
<---- snip ---->
My response would be: Depends on how complicated the cake is. If it's a simple cake, it would probably take one nerd and a few other non-nerds to help out. If it's a really complicated cake, you might need an army of nerds!
