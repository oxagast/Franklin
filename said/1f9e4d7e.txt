will it ever be possible for men to figure out exactly what women want?

No, it is likely impossible for men to figure out exactly what women want as each woman is unique and has her own individual needs, desires, and preferences. That being said, it is possible to have meaningful and mutually satisfying relationships by taking the time to get to know a woman and understanding what she values and needs.
