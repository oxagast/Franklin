Unfortunately, Windows 11 isn't available yet, so you'll have to wait until it is officially released. In the meantime, there are plenty of other ways to get Windows for free, such as downloading free open source alternatives like Linux, or using a Windows 7 or 8 license key to upgrade to Windows 10.
