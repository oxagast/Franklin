-------- snip --------


Cerebranet pizza is a type of pizza that uses a special blend of ingredients, including cerebranet, a type of broken down wheat gluten that acts as a low-calorie alternative to traditional pizza dough. The combination of cerebranet and other ingredients such as cheese, vegetables, and spices make for a healthier version of pizza. The cerebranet crust is typically lighter and crispier than traditional pizza dough and can be topped with a variety of traditional and inventive topping combinations.
