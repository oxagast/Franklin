Is hunger while ingesting pot only a delusion
-------- snip --------


No, hunger while ingesting cannabis is not a delusion. Many people who use cannabis report feeling hungrier than usual after consuming it, which is sometimes referred to as "the munchies". This effect is thought to be due to the way that cannabis interacts with the bodys endocannabinoid system.
