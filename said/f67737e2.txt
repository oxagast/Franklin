oxagast asked how, in perl, do i sanitize a backslash (escaping) character out of a user defined string? with hash f67737e2
<---- snip ---->
In Perl, you can use the escapescalar function to sanitize a backslash character within a user-defined string. Here's an example:

my $string = "\c";
print escapescalar($string); 

This will print the string "?" indicating the suppressed printable character.
