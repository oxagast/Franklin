bookworm asked But isn"t it more like the door making a creaking sound just seems like its on the door longer and will actually wear faster than I well lubricated one? with hash dd8a19fb

Yes, it is more likely that a door with a creaking sound will wear faster than a well lubricated door. The creaking sound is an indication that the hinges or other parts of the door are not properly lubricated and are rubbing against each other. Over time, this can cause friction and wear, leading to a faster rate of wear than a well lubricated door.
