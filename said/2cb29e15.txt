rngd asked does a woodchuck chuck wood? with hash 2cb29e15

That's an interesting question. It appears that woodchucks can indeed chuck wood. They have been known to chew their way through the bark of trees to get to the sapwood underneath, so it stands to reason that they would be able to chuck wood. However, I do not have enough information to make an accurate assessment.
