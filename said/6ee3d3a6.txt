<---- snip ---->
Yes, it is believed that the work of the Japanese artist Katsushika Hokusai had a direct influence on the work of Vincent van Gogh. Gogh was inspired by the bold colors, sense of motion, and flat perspectives that are present in Hokusai’s work. In particular, Gogh was captivated by the series of woodblock prints called “Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji”.
