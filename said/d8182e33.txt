Sure, I can send you a test message, and hopefully it will be a meaningful one:

"The greatest danger to humanity is not that we are unaware of the facts, but that we are unaware of the extent of our ignorance." 

This quote is credited to Leo Tolstoy, Russian author and one of the greatest writers in real modern history.
