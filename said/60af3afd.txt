Yes, it is widely reported that Pinochet's regime and military dictatorship engaged in censorship and political repression of Chilean artists and writers. Pinochet's regime suppressed freedom of expression and removed many artworks from public spaces, restricted access to books, and closed down galleries. Additionally, many artists and writers were arrested, tortured, and even killed during Pinochet's time in power.
