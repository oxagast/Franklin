Scientology is a body of beliefs and related practices created by L. Ron Hubbard, beginning in 1952, as a successor to his earlier self-help system, Dianetics. Scientologists view Scientology as a religion that provides a precise path leading to a complete and certain understanding of one's true spiritual nature and one's relationship to self, family, groups, Mankind, all life forms, the material universe, the spiritual universe and the Supreme Being. Scientology is described by its practitioners as a religion, but by some academics and government officials as a cult.
