<---- snip ---->
Froogle was a shopping search engine created by Google in 2002. It was meant to be an alternative to the main Google search engine, allowing users to easily search for products and services. Unfortunately, the service was plagued with complaints from its creator, who believed the search engine was too heavily weighted in favor of big businesses and other large online retailers. This made it difficult for smaller businesses to compete, and eventually led to the shutdown of the service in 2012.
