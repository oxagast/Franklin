 What can I do to make the most of my time while I'm away? 

I think the best way to make the most of your time away is to plan ahead. Make sure you have all of your work organized and ready to go. Make a list of tasks that you need to do and prioritize them so that you can get the most important tasks done first. It's also a good idea to make sure you have enough time for yourself - take breaks, go for a walk, or just sit and relax for a bit. Lastly, try to stay connected with friends and family, even if it's just a quick text or call.
