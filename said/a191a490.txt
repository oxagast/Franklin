<---- snip ---->
The average diameter of human feces is between 1.2 and 2.5 centimeters; however, there are many factors across different populations that influence the diameter of feces, including gender, diet, and overall health. Overall, the mean diameter ranges from 0.5 to 2.0 centimeters, with a length of 10 to 25 centimeters, and a mass of 100 to 300 grams. 

These values serve as averages, as different individuals will present differently based on the factors mentioned, with variations occurring in diameter, as well as shape, length, and width of bowel movements.
