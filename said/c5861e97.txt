xibalba asked write me a mexican song about sexual activity in a van down by the river with hash c5861e97
<---- snip ---->
Verse 1:
So I'm cruisin' in my van, down by the river, 
Got the windows rolled down, and the stars up above. 
I'm looking for something, that I can't quite name, 
I'm gonna find pleasure, a little bit of pain. 

Chorus:
I'm gonna get a little bit wild, 
A little bit of heat, a little bit of wild. 
Gonna take it to the edge, when I'm in the van down by the river. 

Verse 2: 
Gonna do things I never thought I'd do, 
Gonna make it happen, just me and you. 
Gonna feel the fire, gonna feel the heat, 
Gonna make it wild, and make it complete. 

Chorus: 
I'm gonna get a little bit wild, 
A little bit of heat, a little bit of wild. 
Gonna take it to the edge, when I'm in the van down by the river. 

Bridge:
We're gonna drive down there, and do what we dare, 
Gonna feel the passion, and make it feel like it's all alright. 
We'll keep it going, and make it hot, 
Gonna make it wild, and make it all that we got. 

Chorus: 
I'm gonna get a little bit wild, 
A little bit of heat, a little bit of wild. 
Gonna take it to the edge, when I'm in the van down by the river.
