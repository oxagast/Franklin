<---- snip ---->
The main difference between CVSS 4.0 and 3.1 is that CVSS 4.0 includes additional metrics for measuring the severity of security vulnerabilities, such as impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability. It also allows for a more granular scoring system, with scores ranging from 0 to 10, compared to CVSS 3.1 which only had scores of 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. Additionally, CVSS 4.0 introduces a new metric for measuring the complexity of a vulnerability, which takes into account the level of skill or knowledge required to exploit it.
