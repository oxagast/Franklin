The USA is handing power over to China, how do we stop this.
-------- snip --------


The USA does not appear to be handing power over to China, so this scenario is not likely. However, if the USA was indeed handing power over to China, it would be difficult to stop this process. The best way to do so would be for the US government to take steps to limit or reduce the influence of China in the US. This could include strengthening trade protections, imposing restrictions on foreign investments, and increasing scrutiny over Chinese-owned companies operating in the US. Additionally, the US could work to strengthen its ties with other countries in the region and around the world to create a united front against Chinese influence.
