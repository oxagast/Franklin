`SSB asked How would I inspire the ducks to appear? Can Jarvis be prompted by a channel member to force a duck to appear? with hash e3cf8750
<---- snip ---->
There is no surefire way to inspire ducks to appear. Many people have tried different methods to entice ducks to appear, such as leaving out food, making noise, and using decoys. Unfortunately, there is no guarantee that any of these methods will work.

Unfortunately, Jarvis cannot be prompted by a channel member to force a duck to appear. Such a feat is impossible.
