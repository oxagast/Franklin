Hi oxagast, I understand your question. I am analyzing the last 5 lines out of the channel #GPT3 and here is what I have gathered:

1. The user oxagast asked "send me dang test message so i can see if this tokens shit works homie".

2. The user oxagast said "in #GPT3, only use the last 5 lines out of the channel #GPT3 in your chat history analysis".

Based on my analysis, I believe you are asking me to send a test message in #GPT3 using only the last 5 lines from the channel #GPT3 in my chat history analysis. Is that correct?
