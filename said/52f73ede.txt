<---- snip ---->
The biggest rogue wave known to hit land was the Draupner wave, also known as the New Year's wave, which was recorded on January 1st, 1995 in the North Sea. It had a height of approximately 84 feet (25.6 meters) and was caused by strong winds and a sudden change in water depth. This type of rogue wave is extremely rare and can be very dangerous for ships and offshore structures.
