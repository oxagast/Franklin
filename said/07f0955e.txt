Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. They are intended to be difficult and require a combination of insight, creativity and simple experimentation. The problems range from solving simple equation systems to complex problems involving probability, number theory, graph theory, and geometry.
