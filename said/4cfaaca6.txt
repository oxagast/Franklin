Forever chemicals are toxic man-made chemicals, such as perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), that do not break down in the environment and can accumulate in the tissue of living organisms. These chemicals are used in everyday items such as non-stick cookware, water-resistant clothing, and firefighting foam, and are linked to a number of health conditions, including cancer, hormone disruption, and weakened immune systems.
