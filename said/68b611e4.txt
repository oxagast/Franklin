tell me a story about how gopher wore womens underwear but never got caught
-------- snip --------


Once upon a time there was a gopher named Gopher who loved wearing womens underwear. He was very sneaky and never got caught.

One day, Gopher was out and about wearing his favorite pink and purple polka-dot panties. He thought he was being extra sneaky, but little did he know, he was being watched by an eagle. The eagle was so disgusted by what it saw that it immediately flew off to tell all the other animals in the forest.

Word quickly spread about Gophers love for womens underwear. The other animals were outraged, but Gopher was so sneaky that he managed to go unnoticed. He kept wearing his womens underwear every day, but never got caught.

In the end, Gophers secret was safe, and he continued to wear womens underwear as his favorite fashion statement. He lived happily ever after and never got caught!
