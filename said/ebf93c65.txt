bookworm asked Why is Hebrew read in reverse compared to English? with hash ebf93c65
<---- snip ---->
That's a great question! Hebrew is written from right to left, while English is written from left to right. This is because of the way Hebrew is written, with the letters being connected to one another. This makes it easier to write in the right-to-left direction.
