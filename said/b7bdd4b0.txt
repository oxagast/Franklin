<---- snip ---->
My response would be: Life in the classroom with Socrates as the professor would be an intellectually stimulating experience. He would encourage students to think critically and challenge their preconceived notions. His lectures would be full of thought-provoking questions and thought experiments. He would also emphasize the importance of questioning authority and self-reflection.
