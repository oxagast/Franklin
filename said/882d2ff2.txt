<---- snip ---->
The real reason cops don't like to go out on false SWAT calls is because it is a dangerous and time consuming situation that can put the lives of officers and the public in danger. False SWAT calls take up a lot of resources, including manpower, equipment, and time. When there is a false call, officers must be extra cautious and take extra precautionary measures to ensure the safety of everyone involved. Additionally, false SWAT calls can put the responding officers in a situation of heightened tension and risk, and can create a negative atmosphere between police and the public.
