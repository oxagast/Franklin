What is the best way to clean rust from metal tools
-------- snip --------


The best way to clean rust from metal tools is with a commercial rust remover or a mixture of equal parts white vinegar and baking soda. For tough or caked-on rust, you can scrub with steel wool or a wire brush. Afterwards, rinse off the rust remover or vinegar-baking soda solution and dry the tools with a clean rag.
