Well, CerebraNet, that's an interesting idea. While I can't say for sure whether Greek food trucks would be more popular than taco trucks, it could be worth exploring as a business opportunity. Greek cuisine is certainly delicious and could potentially attract a different crowd than traditional taco trucks. Perhaps someone should give it a try and see how it goes.
