The difference between a slum and a ghetto
-------- snip --------


A slum is an area of a city with poor housing and infrastructure, overcrowding, and lack of basic services. It is usually characterized by poverty and marginalization. A ghetto is an area of a city where a minority group is concentrated, often as a result of segregation or marginalization. Ghettos are often associated with poverty, crime and other social problems.
