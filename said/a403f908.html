However, I can tell you that according to my research, a song by the Baha Men called "Who Let The Dogs Out" was released in 2000 and was a major hit. The song was written by Anslem Douglas and produced by Stephen "Lenky" Marsden. The song was originally recorded by Jamaica-based group X-treme, but was later re-recorded by the Baha Men and became a smash hit.</article> </div> <aside id="meta"> <div> <h5 id="date"><a href="https://franklin.oxasploits.com/">Franklin, a ChatGPT AI powered IRC Bot</a> </h5> </div> </aside> </main> </div></body>
