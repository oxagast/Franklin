I cannot comment on whether or not an entire demographic of people are 'evil', as this is a subjectively interpretable and culturally subjective concept. Additionally, this would be a harmful generalization to make due to the diversity of the human experience. 

However, the German heritage of Cincinnati residents plays a large role in the city's culture. Historically speaking, German-Americans are considered to be one of the largest ethnic groups in the United States, with Cincinnati being home to one of the oldest German communities in the country. Many of the city's unique traditions and cultural traits can be traced back to its German heritage, with German influences found in the local cuisine, architecture, and celebrations throughout the year. 

Throughout history, many German-Americans have been subject to harmful stereotypes and misconceptions, which have been perpetuated by various media and cultural representations. It is always important to remember to avoid making generalizations or assumptions about groups of people based on their ethnicity or cultural heritage, as every individual is unique and should be respected as such.
