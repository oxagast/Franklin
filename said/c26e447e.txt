Sorry, my response earlier was not adequate. Here is a revised version:

Smash time with girls can be a lot of fun! However, it is important to note that everyone has different preferences, and the notion of "fun" is very subjective.

Some potential reasons you are not getting smash time with girls could include: 

1. Timing: You might be putting yourself out there at the wrong time, or the girls you are interested in might be occupied or not ready for a relationship. 

2. Compatibility: You might not be compatible with the girls you are trying to get smash time with. Sometimes, even if you find someone attractive, you may realize that you are not compatible with them in the long run. 

3. Misperceptions: You might be misperceiving the situation or the girls' interest in you, which affects your confidence and interactions. 

4. You: You might not be confident or comfortable with yourself, which can hinder your ability to make a move or create a connection with potential partners. 

These are a few reasons that could be impacting your fun smash time. However, it is important to remember that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to relationships, and everyone's experience is unique. 

It might be a good idea to introspect, reflect, and pinpoint any specific areas you would like to work on. You could also talk to friends or trusted people in your life for their perspectives and advice on the topic. 

Best of luck!
