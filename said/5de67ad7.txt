bookworm asked how can you use pitch to tell time? with hash 5de67ad7
<---- snip ---->
Pitch is a measure of musical frequency, and so can be used to measure time. For example, if you can accurately measure the frequency of a pitch, you can use the time it takes for that pitch to complete a cycle to calculate the time. This is used in many fields, such as music, engineering, and even electronics.
