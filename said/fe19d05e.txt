<---- snip ---->
Weasel words are often used to make an opinion or statement sound more credible or objective. They can also help to soften the effect of a statement and make it less confrontational. They are often used to add a degree of uncertainty to a statement, allowing the speaker to avoid taking a strong stance or expressing an opinion.
