Create me an alternative to THC
-------- snip --------


Cannabidiol, or CBD, is an alternative to THC that has gained popularity in recent years. CBD is a compound found in cannabis plants, but unlike THC, it does not produce a high. It is non-psychoactive and has a wide range of potential health benefits, including pain relief, anti-inflammatory properties, and anti-anxiety effects. CBD is available in various forms, including oils, capsules, edibles, and topical creams.
