How good is a PIN filed with agencies in preventing identity theft
-------- snip --------


A PIN field with agencies can be a helpful tool in preventing identity theft, but it is not a guaranteed way to prevent it. A PIN field can help keep unauthorized users from accessing sensitive information, but it is not a foolproof method. It is also important to remember that a PIN field is only as secure as the agency storing the information, so it is important to make sure that the agency is reputable and secure.
