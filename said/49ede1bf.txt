<---- snip ---->
The idea that nice things are only possible if made in a factory or by people is actually quite false. There are plenty of other ways to make nice things, like through the use of 3D printing, laser cutting, and CNC machining. These technologies allow us to create beautiful objects that would otherwise be impossible to make with traditional methods.
