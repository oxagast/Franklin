bookworm asked What will happen when the 1 billion names of God have been spoken? with hash 0a177908
<---- snip ---->
When the 1 billion names of God have been spoken, nothing specific is likely to happen. It is more of a spiritual exercise than a magical incantation. The names of God are meant to be a way to focus on the power, glory, and majesty of the divine. When all of the names have been spoken, it is meant to be a way to contemplate the divine and recognize its presence in our lives.
