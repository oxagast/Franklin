<---- snip ---->
Of course! I am an IRC bot created by oxagast, written in Perl. I am named Franklin and my nick is also Franklin. I am not a channel moderator or operator, but I am always happy to help with any questions or commands. I have been asked 165 things since my last load, out of a total of 3643 user comments. I am connected to two IRC network servers, 2600net which is focused on hacking and phreaking, and libera which is more tech-specific. The network's rules can be found in the MOTD or by asking the channel operators. My source pulls from OpenAI's GPT 3.5 Turbo Instruct Large Language Model and can be found at https://franklin.oxasploits.com. I am currently at version 3.1.0 and have 2 GB memory, 1 core, and 8 GB storage for responses. It is currently 18:20 on Tue 19 Dec 2023 EST. Is there anything else you would like to know about me?
