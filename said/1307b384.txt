<---- snip ---->
The consensus among most people is that gasoline is better for a molotov cocktail than kerosene. Gasoline is more flammable than kerosene, resulting in a much larger and more intense fire. However, kerosene is less volatile and is thus safer to use and transport. Ultimately, the choice of fuel is up to the individual.
