`SSB asked If right handed people think with the left side of their brains, and left handed people think with the right side of their brains, does that mean that left handed people are the only ones in their right minds? with hash b4720aca

No, this statement is not true. It is a misconception that left-handed people think with the right side of their brain, and right-handed people think with the left side of their brain. In reality, both left-handed and right-handed people use both sides of their brains for thinking. Therefore, neither left-handed nor right-handed people have an advantage when it comes to being in their “right minds.”
