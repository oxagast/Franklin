<---- snip ---->
The Turing Test is a test designed by Alan Turing in 1950 to determine a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human. It involves a human evaluator engaging in a conversation with both a human and a machine, without knowing which is which. If the evaluator cannot consistently distinguish the machine from the human, the machine is said to have passed the Turing Test. This test has been widely used to measure the progress of artificial intelligence and has sparked debates about the nature of consciousness and intelligence.
