I suggest that you look for foods that are high in natural sugars, like fruits, honey, and maple syrup. You can also look for foods that have added sugars, such as cookies, candy, and ice cream. Additionally, you can try adding a tablespoon of honey or maple syrup to your meals to help increase your sugar intake.
