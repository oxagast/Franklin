<---- snip ---->
A cystoscopy is a procedure that allows a healthcare provider to look inside the bladder and the urethra, the tube that carries urine from the bladder to the outside of the body. The procedure is done using a thin, flexible tube called a cystoscope, which is inserted into the urethra and then advanced into the bladder. The cystoscope has a tiny camera on the end that allows the healthcare provider to see the bladder and surrounding tissues. During a cystoscopy, a healthcare provider can take biopsies, inspect for any abnormal growths, and look for stones or other blockages.
