Both empires experienced rapid expansion, followed by economic and political instability. The Roman Empire faced military overreach, increased taxation, and an influx of immigrants that strained public services. Similarly, the USA faces military overreach, increasing taxation, and an influx of immigrants that have strained public services. Both empires also faced a weakening of the rule of law and a growing sense of distrust and division among citizens. The Roman Empire ultimately fell due to a combination of internal and external threats, and many analysts have argued that a similar fate awaits the USA if current trends continue.
