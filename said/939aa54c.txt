My response would be: It depends on what you're trying to do. If you're looking to gain access to sensitive information, you'll need to find a vulnerability in the system you're trying to hack. If you're looking to cause disruption, you'll need to find a way to exploit the system you're targeting. In either case, it's important to do your research and make sure you understand the risks before you attempt any hacking.
