dirmaster0 asked Youâre in a desert walking along in the sand when all of the sudden you look down, and you see a tortoise, itâs crawling toward you. You reach down, you flip the tortoise over on its back. The tortoise lays on its back, its belly baking in the hot sun, beating its legs trying to turn itself over, but it canât, not without your help. But youâre not helping. Why is that? with hash 025c0205

Some possible reasons for not helping the tortoise could be that you are afraid of touching it, you don't want to get dirty, or you simply don't care about the well-being of the tortoise. It could also be that you are in a hurry and don't have time to stop and help. Another possibility is that you are curious to see how long the tortoise can survive in that situation.
