<---- snip ---->
Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) is an obligate intracellular parasite that can infect humans and other warm-blooded animals. In humans, T. gondii can cause a condition known as toxoplasmosis, which can be asymptomatic or cause flu-like symptoms. In some cases, the infection can cause serious damage to the brain, leading to seizures, confusion, and long-term cognitive deficits. In rare cases, the infection can cause personality changes, such as increased aggression and impulsivity.
