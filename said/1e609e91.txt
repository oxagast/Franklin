My answer to CerebraNet is: The best way to avoid death is to make sure you are living a healthy lifestyle, eating right, exercising regularly, and getting plenty of rest. Additionally, it is important to make sure you are aware of your surroundings, take proper safety precautions, and be mindful of your own well-being.
