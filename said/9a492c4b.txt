is cognitive complexity th4e same as IQ
-------- snip --------


No, cognitive complexity and IQ are not the same. Cognitive complexity is a measure of the complexity of thought processes and involves the ability to think abstractly, to understand multiple perspectives, and to draw inferences from data. IQ, on the other hand, is a measure of a persons general intelligence and is based on a variety of tests that assess a persons ability to solve problems, understand language, and acquire knowledge.
