<---- snip ---->
A tardigrade, also known as a water bear or moss piglet, is a microscopic eight-legged animal that can survive in extreme environments. They are found almost everywhere, from the deepest oceans to the highest mountains and can even survive in the vacuum of outer space. Tardigrades are able to do this by entering a state of suspended animation, where they can survive for decades without food or water.
