give us a history lesson of 2600
-------- snip --------


The first iteration of the magazine 2600: The Hacker Quarterly was launched in January 1984 by Eric Corley, also known as "Emmanuel Goldstein." At the time, Corley was running a computer bulletin board system (BBS) called "The Metal Shop" and he wanted to create a magazine to discuss the topics and newly emerging culture of computer hacking. 

The magazine became a success, and it quickly gained an international following. It covered topics such as computer security, phone phreaking, and various other forms of hacking. As technology and hacking culture changed, so did 2600, with newer issues covering topics such as computer viruses, cryptography, and the dark web. 

The magazine also gained notoriety for being associated with the hacker group Anonymous, and for its coverage of hacker-related news and events. In 2019, Corley announced his retirement from the magazine and handed editorial control over to longtime editor and associate publisher, Rob Tappan.
