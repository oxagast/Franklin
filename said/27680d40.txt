The best way to gain weight is to eat more calories than your body burns. Eat healthy, nutrient-dense foods like lean meats, vegetables, fruits, and whole grains. Exercise regularly to increase muscle mass and help your body build lean muscle. Make sure to get enough rest and sleep to support muscle growth.
