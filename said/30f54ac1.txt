<---- snip ---->
Richard Stallman wears the same burgundy polo shirt as a form of protest against the fashion industry's wasteful practices. He has worn the same shirt for over 20 years, to demonstrate that one does not need to buy new clothes to look good. Stallman believes that the fashion industry encourages the idea of constantly buying new clothes, which leads to excessive waste and the mistreatment of workers in developing countries. Stallman's choice of clothing is also symbolic of his dedication to open-source software and his commitment to the use of freely available software and hardware.
