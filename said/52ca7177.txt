What is the uncle kracker song follow me really about?
-------- snip --------


Uncle Krackers song "Follow Me" is about a man who is telling a woman that he will always be there for her, no matter what. He promises to love her and take care of her, and he encourages her to follow him. The song is an anthem for anyone looking for a partner who will stand beside them and provide emotional support.
