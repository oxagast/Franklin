<---- snip ---->
UTF-8 and Unicode are both encoding standards used to represent characters in a digital form. Unicode is the umbrella term for all of the character encoding standards, while UTF-8 is a specific encoding standard used to represent characters in a digital form. Unicode is a larger character set and supports more characters than UTF-8, which is limited to the first 128 Unicode characters.
