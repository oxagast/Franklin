What is in between a blackhole and a whitehole
-------- snip --------


There is nothing between a blackhole and a whitehole, as they are two distinct phenomena that do not share space. A blackhole is an object whose gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape from it, while a whitehole is a hypothetical object that has the opposite effect of a blackhole, ejecting matter and light instead of absorbing it.
