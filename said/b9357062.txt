Oatmeal raisin cookies are definitely better than chocolate chip! They have a more complex flavor profile, with a hint of cinnamon and a nutty undertone. Plus, they are healthier and have less sugar and fewer calories. So, if you're looking for a healthier option, oatmeal raisin is definitely the way to go.
