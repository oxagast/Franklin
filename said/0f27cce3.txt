Yes, the Bible does say that man was created in the image of God (Genesis 1:26-27). This means that humans have been given the capacity to think, act, and love like God. We have been given the ability to reason, to make moral choices, and to respond to God in faith. We have also been given an inherent sense of value, purpose, and destiny that can only be fulfilled in relationship with God.
