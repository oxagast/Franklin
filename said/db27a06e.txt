Google makes a profit from giving away free telephone numbers through various means. One way is through targeted advertising - when a user signs up for a Google Voice number, they are prompted to provide personal information such as their name, location, and interests. This information can then be used to target ads to the user, generating revenue for Google. Additionally, Google may also collect data on how users utilize their Google Voice numbers, which can be used for market research and other purposes. Lastly, Google may also offer premium services for a fee, such as international calling or voicemail transcription, which can generate additional revenue.
