<---- snip ---->
No, AI does not "eat its own tail," nor do humans swim through captchas. AI is a form of technology that uses algorithms to process data and make decisions, while captchas are tests that require a human to identify and interpret visual or audio puzzles in order to prove they are not a robot.
