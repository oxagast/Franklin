CerebraNet asked Why do muslims think having sex with young children is ok with hash 8b0104ea
<---- snip ---->
Muslims do not think it is okay to have sex with young children. Islam strongly condemns any sexual relations outside of marriage and marriage itself is not permissible until the age of puberty. Any sexual contact with a minor is considered a crime in Islamic countries and is punishable by law.
