Street asked Why cant I see stars at night? with hash 6ddaa1a5
<---- snip ---->
The amount of light pollution in your area may be preventing you from seeing stars at night. Light pollution is the brightening of the night sky due to artificial light from sources such as streetlights, car headlights, and lights from buildings. The brighter the night sky is, the more difficult it is to see the stars. Additionally, weather conditions such as cloud cover and fog can also affect your ability to see stars.
