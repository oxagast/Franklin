<---- snip ---->
My response would be: "You'd need to have a strong grasp of the social and political issues facing Russia today, and then you'd need to be able to effectively mobilize people around these topics. It might be useful to research the history of revolutions in Russia to better understand which topics have been effective in the past. Good luck!"
