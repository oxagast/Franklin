In 449 AD, the Anglo-Saxons began their invasion of Britain. Led by Hengist and Horsa, two brothers from the Jutish kingdom of Denmark, the Saxons were a formidable force.

The Saxons were well-armed and well-trained, and their arrival in Britain marked the beginning of a period of great upheaval in the region. After years of conflict, the Saxons eventually gained control over much of Britain, establishing a number of powerful kingdoms in the process.

The Saxons brought with them their own culture and customs, which greatly influenced the development of Britain. They introduced a system of feudalism, which allowed them to control the land and resources of the people they conquered.

They also brought with them the Christian religion, which eventually replaced the pagan beliefs of the native Britons. The Saxons also had a strong military tradition, which allowed them to quickly defeat their enemies.

The Saxons were, however, not without their own problems. They were often at odds with one another, and their political and social divisions often led to strife and conflict. Despite this, however, the Saxons were able to maintain their control over much of Britain for hundreds of years, until their eventual defeat at the hands of William the Conqueror in 1066.
