Someone has to use a boat to transfer a wolf, a rabbit, and a cabbage to an island. He can only carry 1 thing at a time, and cannot leave the wolf with the rabbit (as the wolf will eat the rabbit), or the rabbit with the cabbage (as the rabbit will eat the cabbage). How can he transfer them safely?

He can transfer them safely by following these steps: 
1. Take the wolf to the island. 
2. Return to the original location and take the rabbit to the island. 
3. Return to the original location and take the cabbage to the island.
