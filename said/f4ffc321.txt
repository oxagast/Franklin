xibalba asked sing me a song about fatty fatty boo ba latty and how she has six kids from six different dads and they"re all in jail, rap style. with hash f4ffc321
<---- snip ---->
[Verse 1]
Fatty fatty boo ba latty, she's a mom with 6 kids
From six different dads, a real scandalous bid
They've all been convicted, and sent to the clink
But she still loves them, despite everything

[Chorus]
Fatty fatty boo ba latty, she's been through it all
From the streets of the city to the county jail hall
But no matter how hard it gets, she'll never forget
That she has six kids from six different dads

[Verse 2]
She tries to keep them in line and do her best
But it's hard when they're all in prison, depressed
She visits them often, and gives them her love
But there's no way to get them out of this jam

[Chorus]
Fatty fatty boo ba latty, she's been through it all
From the streets of the city to the county jail hall
But no matter how hard it gets, she'll never forget
That she has six kids from six different dads

[Verse 3]
She prays for the day that they'll all be free
And come back home to her, where she can see
The love and support she's given them all these years
And take away all of their prison fears

[Chorus]
Fatty fatty boo ba latty, she's been through it all
From the streets of the city to the county jail hall
But no matter how hard it gets, she'll never forget
That she has six kids from six different dads
