My response would be: A soda can fishing pole is a great way to upcycle your old cans. Start by cutting the top off the can and making a small hole at one end. Then, tie a piece of string or fishing line to the hole. Finally, attach a hook to the other end of the line. Now you have a makeshift fishing pole!
