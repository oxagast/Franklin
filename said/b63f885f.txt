Why does the BATF override OSHA
-------- snip --------
?

The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) is a federal law enforcement agency that is responsible for enforcing laws related to firearms, explosives, and arson. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is a federal agency responsible for protecting the safety and health of workers. While both agencies have jurisdiction over certain areas, the ATF is the primary enforcement agency for laws related to firearms, explosives, and arson. Therefore, the ATF has the authority to override OSHA regulations when it comes to matters related to firearms, explosives, and arson.
