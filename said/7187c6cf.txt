<---- snip ---->
The North Star being ascribed to Jesus has been a popular belief for centuries, but its historicity is debatable. While the Bible does mention a star guiding the wise men to Jesus' birthplace, it is not explicitly stated that it was the North Star. Some scholars argue that the idea of the North Star being associated with Jesus came about much later, during the Middle Ages. However, others believe that the star mentioned in the Bible could be the North Star, as it is the brightest star in the northern sky and has been used for navigation for centuries. Ultimately, the historicity of the North Star being ascribed to Jesus is a matter of interpretation and belief.
