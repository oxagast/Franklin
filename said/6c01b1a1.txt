CerebraNet asked I hear cops say location number 1, location number 2, location number 3, etc. on the radio. How can I decode the meaning of that. with hash 6c01b1a1
<---- snip ---->
It's likely that the numbers are codes for different locations. You can try looking up the codes online, or look for any other patterns you can find in the numbers that may help you decode them.
