morb asked who would win in a fight, ten thousand duck-sized crabs or one horse-sized amelia earhardt with hash 269ad832

It depends on the context of the fight. The ten thousand duck-sized crabs would have a better chance if the fight were in water, as they would have more mobility and could swarm the horse-sized Amelia Earhart. The horse-sized Amelia Earhart would have the advantage if the fight were on land, as it would be much more powerful than the crabs.
