The Scottish government has announced plans to tackle the "stark" gender pay gap in Scotland, saying it will be the first country in the UK to do so.

The plan includes a new "gender pay gap strategy", which will be launched in the spring of 2020.

The strategy will aim to identify and address the causes of the gap, and to make sure that women are paid equally for the same work.

It will also look at the issues of flexible working, unpaid care and the challenges faced by women returning to work after a break.

The Scottish government said the strategy would also look at ways to encourage employers to "promote fairness and equal pay", as well as measures to help women progress in their careers.

The gender pay gap in Scotland is currently 12.8%, which is higher than the UK average of 8.9%.

The Scottish government said that tackling the gender pay gap is an "economic imperative", as it will help to create a more prosperous and secure Scotland.
