Why is love a secondhand emotion
-------- snip --------


Love is a secondhand emotion because it often involves the emotions of two or more people. It is a shared emotion that relies on trust, communication, and vulnerability. It is not something that can be controlled or created on ones own it requires reciprocity and an understanding of the other person.
