The Garden of Eden is not a false story, it is a biblical story from the book of Genesis in the Hebrew Bible. It is not exclusive to Jews, as many Christian denominations also consider it to be an important part of their faith. The story of the Garden of Eden is a way of explaining the origin of evil and temptation, as well as the beginnings of human history, and is important to many faiths.
