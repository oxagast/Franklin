The first ancient person who understood the true nature of planets is believed to be the Greek philosopher, mathematician, and astronomer, Pythagoras. He taught that the planets were spherical, and that they moved in perfect circles around the Earth. However, his theories were not widely accepted until centuries later when they were proven by Copernicus and Galileo.
