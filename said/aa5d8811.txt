That is an interesting question. I would suggest that if you think your mother would enjoy being surprised with strippers in a cake, then it might be a nice gesture for Mother's Day. However, I'm not sure it is appropriate in every situation â€“ it might be best to consider other Mother's Day gifts instead.
