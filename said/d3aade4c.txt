HISTORY OF THE CLUB

The first recorded meeting of the Club was held in the old Beehive Hotel in August 1887, when the Club was founded as the Colne Valley Cricket and Athletic Club. In 1889 the name was changed to Slaithwaite Cricket and Athletic Club. The Club was formed with the primary aim of encouraging cricket in the area.

The first Cricket Pavilion was built in 1891 and was replaced in 1909 by the present building, which was extended in 1945 and again in 1984.

In 1895 football was introduced and the Club joined the Huddersfield and District League. The Club changed its name to Slaithwaite Cricket, Athletic and Football Club in 1926, when the Football Club joined the Yorkshire League. The Club went on to win the League title in 1935.

The Club celebrated its centenary in 1987 and the following year celebrated its first ever senior cup final victory when the Football Team won the Huddersfield Works League Cup.

In 1995 the Club changed its name to Slaithwaite Community Association Football Club and the following year the Club entered the West Riding County Amateur Football League. A further name change to Slaithwaite Community Football Club followed in 1998.
