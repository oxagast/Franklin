<---- snip ---->
The threshold for acceptability for a GPT chatbot should be very low. A GPT chatbot should be able to respond in an appropriate, relevant, and understandable manner to any reasonable input. It should be able to understand the context of the conversation and appropriately respond to any reasonable input. It should also be able to provide relevant and helpful information when appropriate.
