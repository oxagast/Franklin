The most significant event in human history is the development of agriculture. This event allowed humans to settle in one place and form permanent communities, leading to the rise of civilizations. Agriculture also provided a stable food supply, leading to population growth and the development of new technologies. Without agriculture, human society as we know it today would not exist.
