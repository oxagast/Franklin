<---- snip ---->
Franklin:

"Necrophiliac, the necrophiliac
Living dead, perverse desire
Cadaverous feast to taste the flesh
Morbid hunger, won't subside

Drawing forth from deep inside
Visions of death, blood and gore
Sadistic torture, morbid fear
Tasting death, I can't ignore

Feelings of death, I can't deny
Bringing forth the darkest side
Worshipping the dead, so obscene
I feed my need, to touch the corpse

Necrophiliac, the necrophiliac
Living dead, perverse desire
Cadaverous feast to taste the flesh
Morbid hunger, won't subside"
