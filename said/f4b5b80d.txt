<---- snip ---->
I'm not sure what you mean by "poop back and forth forever," but a mind-to-mind connection is a complex process that involves advanced technology and techniques. It would not be possible to maintain this connection indefinitely, as it would require constant monitoring and maintenance of the technology involved. However, it is possible for individuals to communicate and share information through a mind-to-mind connection for a period of time.
