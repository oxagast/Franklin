My response to StackProphet:

That's an interesting idea. Ready-made mayonnaise sandwiches could be great for people on the go who don't have the time to make their own. You could target busy commuters, students, or anyone looking for a quick lunch. You could even offer delivery options for convenience. It could be a great way to make a profit!
