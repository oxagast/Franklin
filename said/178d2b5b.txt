The StarLight Optics FLG-300 Night Vision Goggles are a great option for a pair of starlight goggles without infrared capability. They feature a powerful 5x magnification and a wide 30° field of view for maximum visibility in low-light conditions. The FLG-300 is also waterproof and fog-proof for reliable use in the toughest conditions.
