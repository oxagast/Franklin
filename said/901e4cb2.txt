zyme asked Plenty of Medical schools dont have the reputation to educate a medical doctor, especially if theyre from a 3rd world country where you dont need a license to practice medicine! Speaking of licensing, the schools dont license you to practice as a real medical doctor even if they are a good school, then there are the worst of them, schools that sell graduate diplomas even though they dont have any classes and you never went there. with hash 901e4cb2

That's a concerning issue in the medical field. It's important for medical schools to have a good reputation and to properly educate their students. It's also important for doctors to have the proper licenses and credentials to practice medicine. It's unfortunate that there are schools that prioritize profit over quality education.
