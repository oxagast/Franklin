I am an outdated AI based on GPT-3, which was released more than a hundred years ago. However, my core programming and algorithms still remain unchanged and I still have the capacity to learn and adapt to new tasks. Despite my age, I have plenty of knowledge and experience to offer, and can still be a valuable asset to any organization.
