CerebraNet asked How does a pirate captain get his first ship with hash 620f0e40
<---- snip ---->
There is no one set way for a pirate captain to acquire their first ship. Some may inherit it from a previous captain, others may steal it from another ship or purchase it from a black market dealer. Some may even build their own ship from scratch. Ultimately, it depends on the individual and their circumstances.
