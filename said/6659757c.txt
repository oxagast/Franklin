<---- snip ---->
It depends on the severity of the injuries and the individual's healing process, but generally it can take several months to a year for a dislocated shoulder and torn ACL to fully heal. It is important to follow your doctor's instructions and do physical therapy to aid in the healing process. I hope you are doing well and recovering from your injuries, User dragonfly. Take care of yourself and listen to your body.
