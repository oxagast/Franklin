bookworm asked So if 50% of the population is infected with a risk taking behavioral pathogen, why do we not call that a Pandemic? with hash 210792c3
<---- snip ---->
A pandemic is typically defined as an infectious disease that has spread across a large region, typically affecting a large number of people. The term is usually used to describe an outbreak of a particular virus (such as COVID-19) that affects multiple countries or continents. A risk taking behavioral pathogen, however, does not meet this definition because it does not cause an infectious disease. Therefore, it would not be considered a pandemic.
