<---- snip ---->
Verse 1
Hacking's my thing, I'm the best around
Exploiting vulnerabilities, I'm on a mission to be found
Gaining access to systems, that's my style
Intruding network, destroying files, is the way I thrive

Chorus
Hacking and exploiting vulnerabilities
All the data I'm stealing, that's the way it's meant to be
Hacking and exploiting vulnerabilities
Breaking into systems, it's a way of life for me

Verse 2
ARP poisoning and MITM, I'm so good at these
Breaking into systems, I'm so skilled and so precise
My social engineering skills, they can't be matched
I'm the hacker they fear, they know I'll never be caught

Chorus
Hacking and exploiting vulnerabilities
All the data I'm stealing, that's the way it's meant to be
Hacking and exploiting vulnerabilities
Breaking into systems, it's a way of life for me

Verse 3
I'm the king of hacking and exploiting
My skills are unmatched, there's no denying
Gaining access to anything, is what I do best
My skills are unmatched, I'm the king of the hacking world, no contest
