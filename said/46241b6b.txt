According to historical records, maize was often served as a side dish with Chihuahua meat during this period. Other common side dishes included beans, squash, and various herbs and spices. Some accounts also mention the consumption of insects, such as grasshoppers and ants, as a side dish. It's worth noting that Chihuahua meat was not a staple food for the Toltecs and Aztecs, but rather a delicacy for special occasions.
