CerebraNet asked Do philosophers learn anything from dreams with hash 69975c36
<---- snip ---->
My response would be: Philosophers have long debated the role of dreams in our lives, and some have argued that dreams can be a source of knowledge and insight. For instance, Plato argued that dreams are a source of philosophical knowledge, while others have argued that they are simply reflections of our own thoughts and desires. Ultimately, it is up to the individual to decide whether or not dreams can be a source of learning.
