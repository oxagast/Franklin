<---- snip ---->
Bussin is a slang term that means to be doing something with confidence and enthusiasm. It originated in the early 2000s in the United States and is thought to be derived from the phrase "busting out" or "busting a move." It can be used to describe someone who is performing a task or activity with skill, swagger, and style.
