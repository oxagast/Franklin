The whistle-blower had been on the run for weeks. She had evidence that the USA had developed Covid in collaboration with Pfizer in order to reduce population and monopolize on the RNA antidote. She had to act fast before they caught her.

She had found out about a secret gathering of the elite hosted by the CEO of Pfizer on his personal yacht in the Caribbean. He was celebrating the success of the collaboration and the financial windfall it had brought them. It was the perfect opportunity to get her evidence out.

The whistle-blower managed to sneak onto the yacht undetected. She crept into the CEO’s office and found the documents she was looking for. She quickly scanned them and made copies of the evidence.

Just as she was about to leave, she heard voices outside the office. It was the CEO and his guests. She hurriedly hid in a nearby closet. The CEO and his guests entered the office and the whistle-blower listened as they discussed their plans for the future.

The CEO boasted about how much money they would make from the RNA antidote, and how it would ensure their monopoly on the market. He also talked about how their collaboration had allowed them to reduce population and control the world’s population.

The whistle-blower was horrified. She knew that if she didn’t get the evidence out, no one would ever know the truth. She had to act fast.

Once the CEO and his guests left the office, the whistle-blower quickly left the yacht and sent the evidence to the media.

The next day, the truth was out. The public was outraged and the CEO and his collaborators were arrested. The whistle-blower was safe, but she knew the fight for justice was far from over.
