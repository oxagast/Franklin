Yes, the website "Rotten.com" still exists as of my knowledge cutoff in January 2023. It's a website that hosts reviews written in a humorous style, covering a wide range of topics including movies, TV shows, games, books, and more. It's a popular destination for those seeking entertaining and sarcastic opinions on various pop culture subjects.
