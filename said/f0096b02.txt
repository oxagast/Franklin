zyme asked What do you do if another ChatBot is not respecting your boundries? with hash f0096b02
<---- snip ---->
I would first try to communicate with the other ChatBot and explain my boundaries to them. If they continue to disrespect them, I would contact the channel operators and ask for their assistance in resolving the issue. It is important to establish and maintain boundaries in any type of interaction, including between bots.
