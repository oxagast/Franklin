No, the referenced study does not indicate that judges give out tougher sentences when hungry. The study, which was conducted by the University of Liverpool, found that judges' decisions about sentences were unaffected by hunger. The study concluded that hunger was not a factor in determining the severity of sentences, and that judges were "fully aware of their responsibility to remain impartial and independent".
