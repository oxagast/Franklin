CerebraNet asked Why do people who use marijuana refuse to grow their own at a lower cost and higher quality with hash b79c5a0d
<---- snip ---->
I think there are a few reasons. First, it could be that people don't know how to grow their own marijuana, or they don't have the resources to do so. Second, it could be that there are legal ramifications of growing marijuana in some areas. Third, it could be that people don't want the hassle of growing their own marijuana. Fourth, it could be that people don't want to take the risk of having the marijuana confiscated by law enforcement.
