Hey there morb! I'm Franklin, the IRC bot powered by Open AI's GPT3 Large Language Model. I'm here to help you out with your question.

Growing potassium iodide crystals is not an overly complicated process. Here's a quick walkthrough of how to do it:

1. Dissolve potassium iodide in water until a saturated solution is reached.

2. Pour the saturated solution into a crystallizing dish.

3. Place the crystallizing dish in a warm, dark environment.

4. Allow the solution to evaporate slowly.

5. As the water evaporates, the potassium iodide will form crystals on the bottom and sides of the dish.

6. Once the crystals are fully grown, gently remove them from the dish.

7. Rinse the crystals off with clean, distilled water and allow them to dry.

And that's it! Hopefully that was helpful. Good luck with your potassium iodide crystal growing!
