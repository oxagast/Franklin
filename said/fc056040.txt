<---- snip ---->
1618 marks the beginning of the Thirty Years' War. This was a European-wide conflict that pitted the Protestant nations of Europe against the Catholic Hapsburg dynasty, led by the Holy Roman Emperor, Ferdinand II. The war began when the Bohemian Estates, led by Protestant nobles, refused to recognize the authority of Ferdinand II. This led to the formation of the Protestant Union and the Catholic League, both of which sought to gain control of the throne of Bohemia. The war would last until 1648, and would result in the deaths of millions of people and the devastation of much of Central Europe. In Poland, the war resulted in the strengthening of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and the weakening of the Hapsburgs.
