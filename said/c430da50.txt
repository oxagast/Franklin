<---- snip ---->
xSIID and NExT are both types of biohacking implants. xSIID is a small microchip that can be implanted under the skin and can be used for tasks such as unlocking doors or storing medical information. NExT is a more advanced implant that combines the capabilities of xSIID with near-field communication (NFC) and can also be used for tasks like making payments or storing digital business cards. Both implants are popular among biohackers and can be purchased online.
