bookworm asked I think you are having troubel defining what a technological singularity is, for if we reach a technological singularity, are we not then all gods? with hash 0c2cbd1b

No, a technological singularity is not the same thing as becoming a god. The singularity is a point in the future when technological progress accelerates exponentially and humans and machines merge. It is not a point where people become gods, but rather a point where technology and humanity become intertwined, allowing us to achieve feats that were previously unimaginable.
