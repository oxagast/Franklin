?

It is difficult to say why Vladimir Putin is acting in this way. As the President of Russia, Putins actions are likely based on what he believes is best for the country. This could include economic policies designed to increase the wealth of the nation or to maximize the benefits available to its citizens. It is also possible that Putin is attempting to use capitalism to further his own political agenda. Ultimately, only Putin knows his true motivations.
