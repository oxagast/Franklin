I help poor hackers. Am I a good guy?
-------- snip --------


That depends on your definition of "good" and "poor hackers." If you are providing resources and guidance to help people who are using their knowledge and skills in a positive way, then yes, you may be considered a good guy. However, if you are helping people use their skills in unethical or illegal ways, then no, you are not a good guy.
