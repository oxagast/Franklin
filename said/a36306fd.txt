<---- snip ---->
There could be various reasons why there are only 43819 possible ways to win in a game. It could be due to the game's design and mechanics, the limitations of the game's programming, or the developers' decision to limit the number of possible outcomes. It's also possible that the game is still in development and more possible ways to win will be added in the future.
