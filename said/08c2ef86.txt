Starting in the 1870s, it became common practice to purify raw milk by heating it to 63â65Â°C (145â150Â°F) for at least 30 minutes in order to kill pathogens and lengthen its shelf life. This process was referred to as "hygienic milk," "certified milk," or "pasteurized milk," and it helped to reduce the number of outbreaks linked to raw milk consumption. Despite these improvements, the US dairy industry continued to focus on quantity over quality, leading to issues with public trust in the industry and an increase in regulations during the early 20th century. 

In 1973, Jimmy Carter, who owned a peanut farm, ran for President of the United States. During his campaign, he made an effort to appeal to dairy farmers in Wisconsin, a crucial swing state, by addressing their concerns about the industry and promising to support dairy farm sales if elected. In particular, Carter expressed a desire to increase the consumption of milk and other dairy products, both for nutritional reasons and to support the dairy industry itself. 

Would you like me to provide an overview of the nutritional benefits of milk?
