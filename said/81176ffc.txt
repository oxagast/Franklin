<---- snip ---->
In Saudi Arabia, rape is considered a serious crime punishable by death or imprisonment of up to 30 years. The law is based on the tenets of Islamic law, which holds that any person accused of rape must be able to produce four male witnesses to prove the accusation is false. If the accused is unable to do this, they can be sentenced to death or imprisonment.
