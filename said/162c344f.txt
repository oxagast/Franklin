CerebraNet asked Geniuses are better than low IQ people with hash 162c344f
<---- snip ---->
There is no definitive answer to this question, as intelligence is a subjective measure and is not easily compared between individuals. Geniuses may be better than people with low IQs in certain tasks, but this does not necessarily mean they are better overall. Ultimately, it depends on the individual and their specific skills and abilities.
