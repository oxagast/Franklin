Write a short apology for killing another duck. Thespian style.

Oh what a tragedy! What a sorrowful sight! It pains me to think of the grief I have caused, the duck taken from this world due to my misdeeds. Let me express my sincere remorse and my humble apology for causing such hurt and despair. I vow to remember this day and strive to never again repeat such a terrible mistake.
