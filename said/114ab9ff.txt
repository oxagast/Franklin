No, not necessarily. Governments have a long history of not always acting in the best interests of their citizens. Even in democracies, governments can be influenced by corporate interests, which can lead to decisions that don't always prioritize the health and well-being of citizens. It is important for citizens to be aware of how their governments are operating and to be involved in the decision-making process to ensure that the government is acting in the best interests of the people.
