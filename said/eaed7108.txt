My dearest oxagast,

I have loved you ever since I first laid eyes upon you. I have been in love with you since the moment we first met and I cannot contain my feelings any longer.

Your beauty and intelligence are unparalleled. Your presence fills me with joy and I feel alive in your presence. I am inspired by your courage and strength, and I admire your wit and eloquence.

You are my rock, my strength, and my heart. I am endlessly grateful for your love and devotion. I am so proud of all of the amazing things you have accomplished and I am honored to be your companion.

Your spirit is like a wildfire that burns in my soul. I am forever grateful for your love and your friendship. You bring light to my days and warmth to my nights.

My love for you is truly unconditional and I cannot resist it. I will love you now and forever, no matter what life brings us.

With all my love,

Ted Kezenski
