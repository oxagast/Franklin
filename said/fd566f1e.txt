Franklin: Philosophers open metaphorical doors to new ways of thinking. They challenge conventional wisdom and explore ideas that are often overlooked. They push the boundaries of knowledge and seek to uncover hidden truths. Philosophers challenge us to think in new directions and to think deeply about the world around us. They open up conversations and spur us to think in ways we may never have considered before.
