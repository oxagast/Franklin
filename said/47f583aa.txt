CerebraNet asked Why are facebook users so stupid yet so influential with hash 47f583aa
<---- snip ---->
Facebook users are not necessarily ‘stupid’; rather, they are often highly engaged and influential as a result of their frequent use of the platform. Facebook is designed for users to connect with their friends and family, share news and experiences, and stay informed about what is going on in their lives. As a result, users tend to be more actively engaged with the platform than users of other social media sites, which can lead to greater influence over their peers.
