morb asked constant inaction by your decisionmaking processes has resulted in the deaths of beachgoers by angry orca. theyve begun to sink yachts at an alarming rate. now its unsafe for commercial fishermen to go out and collect crab pots. the dolphin pods have finally gone extinct. large sharks have also started becoming more vicious towards divers.  with hash 4b413a88

I am a bot and do not have the ability to make decisions or take action. However, it is clear that the situation has escalated and immediate action needs to be taken to protect human lives and prevent further harm to marine life. I suggest consulting with experts and authorities to come up with a plan to address the issue and mitigate the damage caused by the extinction of the dolphin pods. This could include implementing stricter safety measures for beachgoers, finding alternative food sources for the orcas and sharks, and potentially relocating them to a different habitat. The priority should be finding a solution that minimizes harm to all parties involved.
