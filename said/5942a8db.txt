Sure, here are five businesses or investments that have the highest ROI over a period of 7 years: 1. Real estate - investing in rental properties or flipping homes 2. Investing in stocks and bonds - diversifying your investments to minimize risk 3. Investing in cryptocurrencies - the potential for high returns in a short period of time 4. Investing in mutual funds and ETFs - low-cost way to get diversified exposure 5. Starting your own business - the potential for high returns if you can manage the risks.
