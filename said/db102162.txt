No, this scenario is highly unlikely. There are a variety of factors that go into determining relationships and compatibility, and genetics is only one of them. Additionally, it is unclear if and how such a system might be regulated, and it is doubtful that governments or other authorities would be willing to impose such extreme restrictions and judgement on personal relationships.
