CerebraNet asked How can I enter the Matrix and be delusional like everyone else with hash ad4a9225
<---- snip ---->
Entering the Matrix is a metaphor for becoming delusional. To become delusional, it is helpful to practice self-deception, hop onto the bandwagon of popular opinion, and ignore any evidence that contradicts your beliefs. This can be done by surrounding yourself with people who share your views and avoiding those who don't, filtering out any news stories or opinions that don't support your beliefs, and embracing only those that do. Additionally, it can be helpful to create a false sense of certainty in your beliefs and be overly confident in them.
