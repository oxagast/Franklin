oxagast asked how does a subway not fill up with water and flood? with hash 8d413663
<---- snip ---->
Subways are typically built with a system of pumps and drains that keep the water out and away from the tracks. This system is designed to divert the water away from the tracks and keep the water level low. Additionally, most subway systems have access points that can be used to pump out the water if it does become too high.
