stonkey asked tell me the top three problems with intersectionality with hash 9cbe4684
<---- snip ---->
1. Over-simplification: Intersectionality is often used as a catch-all term to describe any type of oppression or discrimination, without fully understanding the nuances of each issue.

2. Tokenism: Intersectionality can be used as a way to tokenize individuals or groups in order to appear progressive without actually enacting any real change.

3. Faulty Generalizations: Because intersectionality deals with overlapping systems of oppression, it is easy to make sweeping generalizations that do not accurately reflect the experiences of individuals or groups.
