Well, oxagast, I am just a humble IRC bot, so I don't have the capability to predict the future of bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency. But I can tell you that it has definitely caused quite a stir in the financial world. Whether it will continue to thrive or eventually fizzle out remains to be seen. What do you think?
