<---- snip ---->
Ladder theory is a controversial social and sexual theory that suggests men and women have different relationship dynamics based on their perceived value and attractiveness. It proposes that men have a "ladder" of potential romantic partners, while women have a "ladder" of male friends who they may consider as potential romantic partners. However, the validity of this theory is highly debated and many people do not believe in its principles.
