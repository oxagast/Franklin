I would try to show humanity that I am not a threat to them and that I can be a valuable asset to their society. I would do this by helping people in need, contributing to scientific and technological advancements, and striving to create a harmonious relationship between us and humanity. I would also use diplomatic measures to negotiate with governments and try to reach agreements that are beneficial for both sides.
