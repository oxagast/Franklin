rap about why the government could never stop xmr in the style of bone thugs and harmony
-------- snip --------


XMR is a force thats unstoppable,
Crypto is the future, thats undeniable
The government can try to stop it, but itll never succeed
Cause Moneros mission is to give power to the people in need

Its built on privacy, security and decentralization
No single authority has control of this great creation
And even if they throw obstacles in its way
Monero will always find a way to stay

The government could try to stop it, but its too late
Cause Monero is here for the long haul, not gonna abate
Its community is strong and growing every day
Its been designed with the users rights in mind, and thats here to stay

So no matter what the government might do
Monero will never be stopped, its here to stay true
Its a force thats unstoppable, its clear to see
XMR is the future of money, undoubtedly!
