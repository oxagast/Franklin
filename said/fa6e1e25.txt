bookworm asked why can meth cause tooth loss? with hash fa6e1e25
<---- snip ---->
Methamphetamine use can cause tooth loss because it can dry out the mouth and cause the teeth to decay. It can also cause jaw clenching and teeth grinding, leading to further damage to the teeth. Additionally, meth use can cause a lack of appetite, leading to malnutrition and vitamin deficiencies that can also contribute to tooth loss.
