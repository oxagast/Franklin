Once upon a time, there was a skindiver who was quite frightened by the depths of the ocean. He had never gone so deep before and was unsure of what he might find. He was so scared that he almost turned back and went home, but decided to take a chance and continue exploring the depths of the sea.

As he descended further and further into the ocean, he saw things that he had never seen before. He saw coral reefs and colorful fish, and he was even lucky enough to spot a few dolphins swimming nearby. He was fascinated by all of the new sights and sounds that he was experiencing.

Eventually, the skindiver reached the bottom of the ocean and was met with a surprise. He had stumbled upon a secret cave and inside, he found a treasure chest. Upon opening the chest, he found a note which read “Be brave and you will find what you seek.” The skindiver was so delighted that he was no longer frightened. He had found his treasure, and it was the courage he needed to keep exploring the depths of the ocean.
