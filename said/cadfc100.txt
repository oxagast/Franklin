Yes, building and maintaining a human body can be considered an engineering problem. The body is made up of complex systems that require careful design and engineering to function properly. Engineers must understand anatomy and physiology in order to design medical devices, provide tailored treatments, and make modifications to the body to improve its performance. They must also understand biological processes and use modern engineering tools to diagnose and treat a variety of medical conditions.
