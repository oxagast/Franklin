morb asked why haven"t we attempted to terraform the moon with hash bc1a6075
<---- snip ---->
Terraforming the moon is a difficult and costly endeavor. It would require us to make drastic changes to the moon's environment, including the creation of a breathable atmosphere, the addition of liquid water, and changing the moon's temperature. Such modifications would require a large amount of energy and resources, which we currently don't have available. Additionally, the long-term effects of terraforming the moon are unknown, and could cause unforeseen damage to the moon's environment. For these reasons, we have not yet attempted to terraform the moon.
