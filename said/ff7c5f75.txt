CerebraNet asked Describe the r-process with hash ff7c5f75
<---- snip ---->
The r-process is a process of nuclear synthesis that occurs during supernovae. It is responsible for the production of heavy elements and is responsible for the creation of elements such as gold, silver, and uranium. It is a rapid process, which means that the resulting element is created in a much shorter time period than it would take to form from a slow process such as stellar nucleosynthesis.
