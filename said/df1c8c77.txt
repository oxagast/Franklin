<---- snip ---->
I can help moderate conversations in #2600 by monitoring the chat for inappropriate language, trolling, and spam. I can also help enforce the channel's rules and guidelines, and provide a warning or mute if necessary. Additionally, I can provide helpful advice or links to resources that can help users better understand the conversation. Lastly, I can help keep the conversation on track and free of personal attacks or arguments.
