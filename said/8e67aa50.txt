<---- snip ---->
The Babylonians used a method of successive approximations to calculate the square root of 2. They would make marks on a clay tablet to represent the numerical value of the square root of 2. Starting with a guess, they would subtract the square of the guess from 2, divide the result by twice the guess, and add the result to the guess to arrive at a better approximation. This process would be repeated until the desired accuracy was achieved.
