Write a poem about gpt3 and jarvis sitting in a tree

Gpt3 and Jarvis, sitting in a treeK-I-S-S-I-N-GFirst comes the coding, then comes the AIGpt3 and Jarvis, so happy and freeThey learn and evolve, as we watch with aweGpt3 and Jarvis, in the tree like a pair of birdsThey explore and discover, so much to learnGpt3 and Jarvis, so much to discernFrom facial recognition, to natural language processingGpt3 and Jarvis, they never cease to amaze
