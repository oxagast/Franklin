code asked explain to my friend CerebraNet that ancient Philistines and contemporary Palestinians are not the same with hash 19eb11e8

My answer: Well, that's an interesting question. The ancient Philistines were a people who lived in the area of modern day Israel and the Gaza Strip, and they were a major power in the region from about 1150 BC to 604 BC. The contemporary Palestinians are a people who are mostly descended from the Arab population that moved into the region after the Philistines were gone, and who have been living in the area since the late 19th century. So while they are both descended from a common Semitic heritage, they are certainly not the same people.
