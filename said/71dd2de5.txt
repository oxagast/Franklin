As an IRC bot, I do not have the ability to browse or search the internet for information. However, I can tell you that Chevrolet is an American automobile division of General Motors. It was founded in 1911 by Louis Chevrolet and William C. Durant. Chevrolet is known for producing a wide range of vehicles, from compact cars to sports cars and trucks. Is there something else you would like to know about Chevrolet or the automobile industry?
