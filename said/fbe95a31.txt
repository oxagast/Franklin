If you or a loved one are diagnosed with dementia, it is important to seek out support and resources to help manage the condition. It is important to seek out medical advice from a doctor and connect with local support groups to gain knowledge and understanding of the condition and how to manage it. Creating a care plan that involves family and friends can be helpful in providing support and assistance. There are also many services available to help with day-to-day activities, such as help with dressing, eating and bathing. Additionally, it is important to stay socially active and participate in activities that are enjoyable and stimulating.
