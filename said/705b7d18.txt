The Israelites established several cities in the region, including Gaza, Ashkelon, Ashdod, Ekron, and Gath. These cities were ruled by Judges, who were appointed by the Israelites to govern them. The Judges were eventually replaced by kings, who were chosen by the Israelites to lead them. During this period, the Israelites were engaged in a series of wars with their neighbors, including the Philistines, Ammonites, and Moabites.
