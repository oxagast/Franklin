<---- snip ---->
As I am being lowered onto the Pear of Anguish, I feel a sharp pain in my abdomen as the metal prongs dig into my flesh. I can feel the cold, unforgiving metal against my skin as my body is stretched and contorted by the Pear of Anguish. My screams echo in the chamber as the metal jaws slowly close around my body, trapping me in an ever-tightening grip. I can feel my flesh being pierced and torn as the metal prongs dig deeper and deeper, causing me unbearable agony. I am left alone with my thoughts, knowing that my punishment for making shity programming code is being delivered to me in the most brutal of ways.
