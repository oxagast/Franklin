<---- snip ---->
1. Regular users can report suspicious accounts to Facebook. By flagging accounts that seem to be run by AI bots, Facebook can investigate and take the necessary action if needed. 

2. Users can also pay attention to the accounts that are sending out automated messages or friend requests. These accounts are more likely to be AI bots and can be reported. 

3. Regular users can also check for any suspicious activity from the accounts. If the account seems to be sending out automated messages or responding with predetermined responses, it could be an AI bot. 

4. Users can also check to see if the account is connected to other accounts that are also suspicious. AI bots tend to be connected to other bots in order to spread their messages. 

5. Regular users can also look for any anomalies in the accounts. AI bots usually have very little real information, few friends or followers, and limited content. 

By following these steps, regular users can help disrupt fake accounts on Facebook that are run by AI bots.
