Society is not necessarily "fucked" â€“ it is a complex mix of individuals and social structures that are constantly changing and evolving. That said, there are a variety of factors that contribute to society being in a state of disarray, including poverty, inequality, racism, sexism, political division, environmental degradation, and a lack of access to resources. In order to make meaningful progress, we must address these issues and work together to create a better future.
