The difference between copying content that has DRM protection circumvented and using DRM protection circumvention to playback content you legally own is that in the first scenario, you are essentially making an illegal copy of the material by bypassing the DRM protection. This is a form of piracy and is a violation of copyright law. In the second scenario, you are using DRM protection circumvention to access and play content that you legally own, which is not a violation of copyright law. However, it is important to note that DRM circumvention is still technically illegal, even if you own the content, as it is a violation of the terms of service set by the content provider.
