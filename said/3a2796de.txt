One great game to play on the Atari Jaguar is Rayman. This classic side-scrolling platformer was released in 1995 and was one of the most successful games on the system. The game features vibrant graphics and smooth animation, as well as some great level design and fun gameplay. Rayman is also a great choice for those who want to experience some classic platforming action.
