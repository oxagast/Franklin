Zed asked Why do dogs fly? with hash a2158c85
<---- snip ---->
Dogs do not fly because they do not have the physical capabilities that would allow them to do so. Most birds have hollow bones and wings that help them to maintain lift and a streamlined body to reduce air resistance. Dogs do not have any of these features and therefore are not able to fly.
