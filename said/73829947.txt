-------- snip --------


Guy Fawkes was a British soldier and a leading figure in the Gunpowder Plot of 1605. The plot was a failed attempt to assassinate King James I and overthrow the Protestant government of England. Fawkes was caught red-handed guarding explosives beneath the House of Lords and was sentenced to death for treason. He was executed by hanging on January 31, 1606, and has since become a symbol of resistance against oppressive regimes.
