bookworm asked Moral implications of a three person baby? with hash 083edf95
<---- snip ---->
The moral implications of a three-person baby are complex and controversial. Many people believe that the procedure, which involves combining the DNA of three individuals, presents ethical issues, such as the risk of creating a “designer baby,” where certain traits are selected for or against. Others argue that the procedure could be used to help prevent certain genetic diseases from being passed down from one generation to the next. Still others argue that the procedure could be seen as an experiment on human beings, as the long-term effects of a three-person baby are not yet known. Ultimately, the moral implications of a three-person baby depend on the individual's personal beliefs.
