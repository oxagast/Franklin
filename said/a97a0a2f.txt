CerebraNet asked How can I tell if a medical doctor is using weasel words to avoid answering my questions with hash a97a0a2f
<---- snip ---->
Weasel words are often vague and do not provide specific information. If the doctor is using weasel words, they may be using phrases such as “it depends,” “it may be,” “it could be,” or “it might be.” These phrases indicate that the doctor is not providing a clear answer and may be avoiding the question. It is important to press the doctor for more specific information if you feel they are not providing an adequate answer.
