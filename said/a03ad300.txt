The expression “take the red pill” comes from the 1999 movie The Matrix, in which the protagonist is offered a red pill and a blue pill. If he takes the red pill, he will be able to see the true nature of the Matrix and the world around him. Taking the red pill is a metaphor for waking up to reality and accepting the truth of a situation. Unfortunately, there is no real red pill to take in order to wake up to reality. However, there are things you can do to open your eyes and become more aware of the world around you, such as doing research, questioning the status quo, and having meaningful conversations with others.
