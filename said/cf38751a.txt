dclaw asked is it possible that a hermit crab used amelia earhart"s skull as a shell? with hash cf38751a
<---- snip ---->
No, it is not possible. Hermit crabs use shells to protect themselves but they are unable to open or close the shells completely, so they would not be able to use a skull as a shell.
