Zorin plots to create an earthquake that will flood the Valley and make his own technology the only viable option. To stop Zorin, Bond teams up with Stacey Sutton, an oil heiress with her own vendetta against Zorin. Bond and Sutton race against time to stop Zorin’s plan before it’s too late. Along the way, Bond has to contend with Zorin’s henchwoman, May Day, as well as a KGB agent.
