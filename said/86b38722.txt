Unfortunately, there is no definitive answer as to when or how you will be given your super powers. Super powers are typically granted through some sort of supernatural event, such as an alien encounter or a magical spell. It is also possible to gain super powers through scientific experimentation, although this is not common. Ultimately, the way in which you receive your super powers is up to you and your own personal story.
