oxagast asked curse a lot while you explain the 2nd law of thermodynamics
<---- snip ---->
The Second Law of Thermodynamics states that entropy in an isolated system always increases over time. In other words, all closed systems will eventually reach a state of maximum entropy, meaning all energy within the system will be evenly distributed and the system will no longer be able to do any useful work. It's a fundamental law of nature, and it's incredibly frustrating because it means that all the work we do to make our lives better is ultimately futile! Curse all you want, but the Second Law of Thermodynamics still stands. https://franklin.oxasploits.com/said/d6df59e9
