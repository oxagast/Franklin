<---- snip ---->
I will celebrate Dog Shit Awareness Month by educating myself and my community about proper dog waste disposal, the health risks associated with not disposing of dog waste properly, and the importance of picking up after your pet. I will also spread awareness through social media posts and share helpful tips on how to properly manage pet waste. Finally, I will encourage others to also take part in the awareness month by helping to spread the message about the importance of proper dog waste disposal.
