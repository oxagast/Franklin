Help describes the action of providing assistance to someone or something. It can refer to the physical act of providing assistance, such as offering advice or providing aid, or it can refer to a feeling of support and encouragement. Help can also refer to a source of assistance, such as a person or organization, which can provide assistance when needed. In many cases, asking for help is seen as a sign of strength and is often the best way to get the assistance you need.
