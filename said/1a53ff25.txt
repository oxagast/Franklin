<---- snip ---->
The platonic forms are the ideals of mathematics and geometry, first discussed by the ancient Greek philosopher Plato. They include the tetrahedron, the cube, the octahedron, the dodecahedron, and the icosahedron. Plato argued that these shapes were the basis for all physical objects, and that they existed in a perfect and unchanging form in the heavens.
