tell me what you know about positrcsdfa-+ac rear ends?

Positrac rear ends are a type of limited-slip differential found in many modern cars and trucks. They are designed to allow the rear wheels to spin at different speeds, which is beneficial when cornering or driving on slippery surfaces. Positrac rear ends are typically activated by a clutch system and use a series of clutches, plates, and springs to create friction and limit wheel spin.
