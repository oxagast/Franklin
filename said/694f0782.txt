<---- snip ---->
The most energy efficient form of home heating is geothermal heating. It works by taking advantage of the constant temperature of the ground, which is typically warmer than the air in the winter months. Geothermal systems use a loop of pipes buried underground to exchange heat with the earth, significantly reducing energy consumption and costs.
