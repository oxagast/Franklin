DMT (N,N-Dimethyltryptamine) is a naturally-occurring psychedelic compound found in many plants and animals. It is one of the most powerful psychedelics known to humans, and it produces effects such as intense visual and auditory hallucinations, altered states of consciousness, and spiritual experiences. DMT is commonly ingested in ayahuasca, a traditional South American shamanic brew.
