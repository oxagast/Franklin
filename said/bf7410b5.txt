LSD (Lysergic acid diethylamide) is a hallucinogenic drug that was first synthesized in 1938. It is most commonly known for its ability to produce altered states of consciousness, including visual and auditory hallucinations, altered sense of time, and changes in emotional state. LSD is illegal in most countries and is used recreationally in some countries. It is not used in any medical or therapeutic setting.
