captain asked Franklin tell me about the technicolor rainbow with hash 6996e3b1
<---- snip ---->
A technicolor rainbow is a type of rainbow that has a wider range of colors than a standard rainbow. It typically features more than the standard seven colors of the rainbow, such as blues, purples, and pinks. The colors can be seen in the same order as a regular rainbow, but with an added layer of vibrancy. Technicolor rainbows are usually caused by the refraction and dispersion of light through ice crystals in the atmosphere.
