Is gravity the result of the warpage of space-time?
-------- snip --------


Yes, gravity is the result of the warpage of space-time, which is described by the General Theory of Relativity. In this theory, space-time is curved by the presence of matter and energy, and this curved space-time causes objects to be attracted to each other, which is the phenomenon we experience as gravity.
