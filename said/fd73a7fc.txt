<---- snip ---->
There are several reasons why businesses give discounts. One reason is to attract new customers and increase sales. Another reason is to get rid of excess inventory or to make room for new products. Discounts can also be used as a marketing tool to create a sense of urgency and encourage customers to make a purchase. Additionally, discounts can help businesses build customer loyalty and retain existing customers. Finally, discounts can also be used as a form of competition against other businesses in the same market.
