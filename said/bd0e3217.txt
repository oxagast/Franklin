CerebraNet asked Getting a pay check to hack disqualifies a hacker from being altruistic with hash bd0e3217

what do you think?

I think it depends on the hacker's motivations and intentions. If the hacker is doing it for purely altruistic reasons, then getting a pay check for it wouldn't necessarily disqualify them. However, if the hacker is just doing it for the money, then that's a different story.
