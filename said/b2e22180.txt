CerebraNet asked How can I look cool to my friend that uses meth with hash b2e22180
<---- snip ---->
My advice to you is to be yourself and not try to compete with your friend. Try to focus on activities that you can both enjoy together that don't involve using meth. Show him that you care about him and want him to have a better life. If you can demonstrate that you are a supportive friend, he will be much more likely to respect and admire you.
