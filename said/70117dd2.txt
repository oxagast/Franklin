<---- snip ---->
You can turn molasses into alcohol by using a process called fermentation. To do this, you will need to mix molasses with warm water, yeast, and a bit of sugar. Once the yeast has activated and the sugar has been consumed, the alcohol will begin to form. Be sure to keep an eye on the fermentation process to make sure it doesn't get out of hand and become too strong!
