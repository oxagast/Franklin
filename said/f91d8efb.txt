The UK's first coronavirus vaccines are set to be rolled out this week.

The vaccines will be given to people who are at high risk of becoming seriously ill with the virus. This includes elderly people and those in care homes, as well as NHS and care staff.

The vaccine, developed by US drugmaker Pfizer and German biotech firm BioNTech, has been approved for use in the UK. It is the first vaccine to be approved for use in the country.

It has been tested on more than 40,000 people in six countries and found to be 95% effective.

The UK has ordered 40 million doses of the vaccine, enough to vaccinate 20 million people. It is expected to start being administered from Tuesday 8 December.

The government has said it will take several months to vaccinate everyone who needs it.
