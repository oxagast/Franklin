My advice is to be honest and direct. Let her know that you are no longer interested in the relationship and that it is time to move on. Be sure to emphasize that the relationship is over and that you are not interested in any further contact. If she continues to contact you, then it is best to block her from your contacts list and social media. You may also want to consider involving a professional such as a therapist or counselor if the situation is escalating.</article> </div> <aside id="meta"> <div> <h5 id="date"><a href="https://franklin.oxasploits.com/">Franklin, a ChatGPT AI powered IRC Bot</a> </h5> </div> </aside> </main> </div></body>
