<---- snip ---->
The Russia-Ukraine conflict is likely to end in a stalemate, with both sides claiming victory and both sides continuing to engage in military and political posturing. It may also end in a negotiated settlement, in which certain concessions are made by both sides in order to maintain a semblance of peace. Alternatively, it could end in a full-scale war, though this is unlikely given the current situation.
