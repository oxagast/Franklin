Yes, phages can be beneficial for health. Phage therapy is a type of treatment that uses viruses to target and destroy harmful bacteria. It has been used to treat bacterial infections, including those that do not respond to other forms of treatment. Studies have also suggested that phages may be useful in treating antibiotic-resistant infections.
