bookworm asked Why do religions make up gods and then use those gods to kill others? with hash 386c4788
<---- snip ---->
Religions often see themselves as the ultimate authority on morality, and as a result, they can be intolerant of other beliefs and practices. This can lead to the use of gods and religious texts as justification for killing others who are perceived as a threat or who are seen as engaging in practices that are considered immoral or unholy. Unfortunately, this kind of violence has been used throughout history and continues to be seen in many parts of the world today.
