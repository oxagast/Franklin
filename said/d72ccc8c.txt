<---- snip ---->
Debt collectors can be rude because they are trying to collect a debt and the debtor may not be willing or able to pay it back. It could also be because debt collectors are often jaded from dealing with people who don't take responsibility for their debts or those with whom they have a history of not paying. Ultimately, it's up to the debt collector to decide how to handle each situation, so it may just be a matter of personal preference.
