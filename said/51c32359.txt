It can be difficult to understand why a human male might be feeling depressed, as the reasons can vary from individual to individual. It is important to understand the root cause of the depression in order to properly address it. In some cases, depression can be caused by a chemical imbalance, while in other cases it can be caused by outside factors such as trauma, job loss, or relationship issues. It is also important to remember that depression can be a sign of an underlying mental health issue, like anxiety or PTSD. Ultimately, the best way to address depression is to seek professional help, as a mental health professional can help you identify the source of the depression and create a plan to address it.
