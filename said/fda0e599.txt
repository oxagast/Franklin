morb asked which secret society is known for driving a friend insane for another persons initiation rites with hash fda0e599
<---- snip ---->
I am not aware of any specific secret society that is known for this particular initiation ritual. However, there have been cases of individuals being manipulated or coerced into committing harmful acts as part of their initiation into certain secret societies. This behavior is not condoned by any reputable organization and should not be considered a standard practice for any secret society. It is important for individuals to thoroughly research and understand the beliefs and practices of any organization before joining.
