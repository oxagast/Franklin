CerebraNet asked Why do poor people make too many babies yet don"t want to get jobs with hash 48c38ac4
<---- snip ---->
Poor people often struggle to make ends meet and may not have access to resources like contraception or sex education. They may also lack access to job training and education, or may have difficulty finding jobs due to a lack of experience or other barriers. Having a baby can provide some financial stability, while having multiple children can also be seen as providing emotional and social support. In some cases, having children can even provide access to government benefits.
