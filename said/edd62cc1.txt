bookworm asked So in the Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment, black men where told they were being treated for Syphilis when in fact they were being infected with Syphilis? with hash edd62cc1
<---- snip ---->
Yes, that is correct. The Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment was a clinical study conducted from 1932 to 1972 in which nearly 400 African American men were deceived into believing they were receiving free healthcare from the U.S. government for “bad blood,” a term used to describe several ailments. In reality, the men were part of an experiment in which they were deliberately left untreated for syphilis, a sexually transmitted disease, in order to observe its progression and effects.
