zyme asked What about the half-Life of a proton?  with hash decd419d
<---- snip ---->
The half-life of a proton is believed to be at least 1.29Ã—10^34 years. However, due to uncertainties in our understanding of the fundamental forces of nature, the exact value is not known. Some theories suggest that the half-life of a proton may be infinite, meaning it may never decay. This is an area of active research in physics.
