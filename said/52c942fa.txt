CerebraNet asked What is the FCC penalty for a cop broadcasting music from his car radio
<---- snip ---->
The FCC does not specify any particular fines for broadcasting music from a car radio, but it is illegal to broadcast on any frequencies without a license. Depending on the circumstances, the FCC may issue a fine of anywhere from several hundred to several thousand dollars. https://franklin.oxasploits.com/said/52c942fa
