If you're looking for something to play on your WonderSwan, we'd recommend trying out the classic adventure game, Symphony of the Night. It's a classic side-scrolling adventure game with a great soundtrack, plenty of secrets to uncover, and a ton of replay value. It's one of the best games available on the WonderSwan, and a great way to spend some time with your classic handheld console.
