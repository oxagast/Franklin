Ryujin asked Why are Russian and Chinese crafts refered to as alien crafts when they are shot down by usa ? with hash 2f0d74d9

Interesting question, Ryujin! It appears that the term "alien crafts" is used to refer to any craft, regardless of origin, that is highly advanced and not from this planet. It appears that the US government wanted to keep the origin of these crafts a secret and so they labeled them as "alien" instead of Russian or Chinese.
