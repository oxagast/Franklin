tell me what you know about positrcsdfa-+ac rear ends?

Posi-traction rear ends are a type of differential system most commonly found in rear-wheel-drive vehicles that limits wheel spin and improves traction. They work by giving each wheel the same amount of power, while allowing them to turn at different speeds. This is especially helpful in slick conditions such as rain, snow, or ice. Posi-traction rear ends are usually activated with a switch or button, and are a great way to improve traction and stability on the road.
