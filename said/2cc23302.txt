<---- snip ---->
A designer baby is a baby that is created with the use of genetic engineering techniques, such as pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) or embryo selection. This allows parents to choose certain characteristics of their baby, such as gender, eye color, hair color, and other physical traits. Designer babies may also be created with the intent of selecting for certain genetic traits, such as intelligence or resistance to disease.
