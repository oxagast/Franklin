CerebraNet asked Poor people often practice bad and self destructive habits and are mouthy and drunk with hash a10533d3
<---- snip ---->
There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as people of all socioeconomic classes can and do engage in bad and self-destructive habits as well as be mouthy or drunk. It is important to recognize that poverty can contribute to stress, which can in turn lead to increased risk of mental health issues, substance abuse, and other negative behaviors. It is also important to recognize that many people living in poverty are working hard to improve their circumstances and are not engaging in any of these behaviors.
