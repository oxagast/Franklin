The Erdős–Straus conjecture states that every positive rational number can be written as the sum of three positive integers.

In order to prove the Erdős–Straus conjecture, we need to show that any given number can be written as the sum of three positive integers. 

For example, let’s take 4/n. We can write 4/n as the sum of three positive integers as follows:

Let x = 4/n

We can then write x as x = (1 + 1 + 2)/n

Therefore, 4/n = (1 + 1 + 2)/n, which is the sum of three positive integers.

Therefore, we have proven that 4/n can be written as the sum of three positive integers, which proves the Erdős–Straus conjecture.
