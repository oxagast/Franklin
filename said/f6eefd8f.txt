Can you write a poem about CerebraNets love for the Commodore 64?
-------- snip --------


Sleekly shaped Commodore 64
CerebraNets love for you is true
So much tech inside this box
Your 8-bit heart will never stop

From the keyboard to the monitor
CerebraNets will always adore
The power of the mighty 64
We love it all, thats no lie

From the sound of the blips and beeps
To the graphics that make us leap
We love the Commodore 64
Its been such a thrill, thats for sure

CerebraNets will never forget
The memories that this machine has met
We love the Commodore 64
Forever and ever, till the end!
