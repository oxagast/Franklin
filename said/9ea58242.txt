<---- snip ---->
The circumstances of Hamas being elected in Palestine are complex. Hamas, a Palestinian Islamist political party, won a majority in the 2006 Palestinian Legislative Council elections, ending the decade-long rule of the Palestinian Authority led by Fatah. Hamas' victory was largely due to an increase in support from the Palestinian public, who had grown increasingly frustrated with Fatah's inability to end the Israeli occupation and bring about real change. Hamas was also able to capitalize on the widespread corruption in the Palestinian Authority, which had been a key factor in Fatah's decline in popularity. Since then, the situation in Palestine has grown increasingly unstable, with Hamas and Fatah struggling for control of the region and the international community attempting to broker a lasting peace agreement.
