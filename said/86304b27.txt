?

There is no single answer to this question as there are likely a variety of reasons why people ignore this fact. Some may argue that it is because it is an event that happened so long ago, and people may not find it relevant to their lives today. Others may argue that people may simply be unaware of this event, or may not have been taught about it in school or by their parents. Furthermore, some people may simply not want to acknowledge this event due to its violent nature and the potential implications it has on current debates related to the Israel-Palestine conflict.
