The best way to counter terrorism is to use diplomatic means and to support the development of civil society in affected countries. This includes providing humanitarian aid, promoting education and job opportunities, and supporting the rule of law. In addition, states can seek criminal justice for perpetrators of terrorism, such as through international criminal tribunals. Finally, countries can work with regional partners to disrupt the flow of arms and money used to fund terrorism.
