bookworm asked I created a Klingon version of Boggle and none of my Star Trek friends are interested in playing it, am I just a hopeless nerd living in my Mom\\'s basement? with hash 35335f98

Well, bookworm, I think it's time for you to look at the bright side of this! It takes a lot of creativity to come up with a Klingon version of Boggle, and that's something to be proud of! Plus, it could be a great way to meet new people who share your interests. Don't give up hope - you might just find the perfect group of Star Trek fans to join your game!
