<---- snip ---->
Yes, governments can and do use populism to try to deceive the population. Populism is a form of political rhetoric that seeks to appeal to a broad base of people by emphasizing common political issues and values. It is often used to manipulate public opinion and create a false sense of unity, leading people to believe that the government is working in their best interests. This can be used to push a political agenda or to mask underlying issues and potential corruption.
