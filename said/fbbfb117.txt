bookworm asked can bad breath be a result of an insufficient phage colony in the mouth? with hash fbbfb117
<---- snip ---->
No, bad breath is not caused by an insufficient phage colony in the mouth. Bad breath is usually caused by the breakdown of proteins in the mouth by bacteria, which produces a sulfur compound. This sulfur compound is what causes bad breath. Other causes of bad breath include dry mouth, certain foods and drinks, smoking, poor oral hygiene, and certain medical conditions.
