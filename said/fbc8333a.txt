RDNt asked Will a nigerian prince send me lots of money if I help him? He contacted me via email. with hash fbc8333a

My response to RDNt is: Unfortunately, no. Nigerian princes are notorious for their scams and the chances of them actually sending you money are very slim. It's best to ignore any emails you receive and just delete them.
