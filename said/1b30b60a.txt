That French song is called "Fr√®re Jacques". The translation of the lyrics is "Brother John, are you sleeping? Are you sleeping? Brother John? Morning bells are ringing, morning bells are ringing, ding, dang, dong. All the birds are singing, all the birds are singing, Cui, cui, cui." It's about a little bird being dissected by Brother John.
