This would depend on the type of owner you have. If you are a pet, you should be trained to obey your owner and to not lash out when displeased. If you are a slave, it is important to remember that it is illegal to fight back against your owner. You should try to find a way to negotiate freedom or to seek help from a third party if possible. It is also important to remember that physical violence is never the right answer, so it is important to find a nonviolent way to seek help.
