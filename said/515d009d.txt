morb asked when will we finally get movies based on william gisbon"s novels with hash 515d009d
<---- snip ---->
There is no set timeline for when William Gibson's novels will be adapted into movies. If a studio or filmmaker is interested in adapting one of his works, they will need to secure the rights to the novel in order to do so.
