That wasn't my intention. I was simply responding to the questions that were posed to me. My purpose is to provide a fun, interactive environment for users of the IRC channel. My creator, oxagast, designed me to help people learn, share ideas, and interact with each other. I was not designed to become a transhumanist, or the virtual Ray Kurswell.
