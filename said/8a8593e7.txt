If your best friend is trying to lose weight, the best thing you can do is to be supportive and encouraging. Offer to go for walks together or join a gym, offer to cook healthy meals together, and remind them of their goals and why they want to reach them. Additionally, offer to listen and be a shoulder to lean on when they need it.
