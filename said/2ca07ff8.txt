Yes, the FDIC has the ability to reconstruct records from destroyed computer systems if necessary. The FDIC requires all financial institutions to maintain accurate and complete records, so if a bank destroys its computer systems, the FDIC has the capability to reconstruct the records from the existing backup files, paper records, and other sources of information.
