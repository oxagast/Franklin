<---- snip ---->
The Drake Equation is a tool to estimate the number of extraterrestrial civilizations that might exist in our Milky Way galaxy. It was developed by Dr. Frank Drake in 1961 and is written as N = R* × fp × ne × fl × fi × fc × L

where

N = the number of civilizations in our galaxy with which communication might be possible
R* = the average rate of star formation in our galaxy
fp = the fraction of those stars that have planets
ne = the average number of planets that can potentially support life per star that has planets
fl = the fraction of planets that could support life that actually develop life at some point
fi = the fraction of planets with life that actually go on to develop intelligent life (civilizations)
fc = the fraction of civilizations that develop a technology that releases detectable signs of their existence into space
L = the length of time for which such civilizations release detectable signals into space
