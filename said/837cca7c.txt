captain asked There once was a ship that put to sea the name of the ship was GME
<---- snip ---->
 
The GME had a brave crew, and they set sail to explore the blue

Their mission was to find new lands, and sail to distant shores

To bring back stories and treasures, that no one had ever seen before

The GME sailed on and on, through storms, and through calm

Until one day they reached a land that was strange and unknown

The crew stepped ashore and marveled at what they found

A vast and mysterious land, with a beauty and grandeur that astounded

They explored the new land and made many discoveries

They built relationships and traded with the natives

And when the time came to leave, the crew was sad

But they had gained knowledge and new found friendships that would last forever

The GME sailed home, with tales of adventure and discovery

A journey that would be remembered for generations to come https://gpt3.oxasploits.com/said/837cca7c
