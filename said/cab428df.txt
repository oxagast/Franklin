<---- snip ---->
Yes, you are just as guilty of the lie as the liar is. It is wrong to knowingly withhold information from someone, especially if that information could potentially be damaging to them. By choosing to stay silent, you are participating in the lie and can be held responsible for any harm that comes to the victim because of it.
