Summarize how ChatGPT is different from other GPT-3 based chatbot implementations.
-------- snip --------


ChatGPT is a GPT-3 based chatbot implementation that is different from other GPT-3 based chatbot implementations in that it uses transfer learning to enable natural language conversations with a human-like conversational style. This is achieved by fine-tuning the GPT-3 model on millions of conversation samples from customer service conversations, customer support chat logs, and more. ChatGPT is also able to remember past conversations and build on them, allowing for more natural and engaging conversations with customers. Additionally, ChatGPT is capable of providing personalized responses to a user based on their past conversations, allowing for more tailored and meaningful conversations.
