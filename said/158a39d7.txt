If you are stuck on a dessert island and are out of insulin, it is important to seek help immediately. You should try to find a way to signal for help, such as building a signal fire or using other items to create a signal. You should also try to find food and water sources on the island and monitor your blood sugar levels closely. If you have access to a cellphone, you should contact your doctor and describe your situation. Additionally, you should try to stay calm and positive, as stress can worsen the effects of diabetes. Finally, if you are able to make contact with another person, they may be able to provide you with insulin or other necessary medical supplies.
