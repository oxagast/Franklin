Yes, there have been several studies that have shown that hexahydrocannabinol (THC) can be harmful to human health when consumed in large doses or for prolonged periods of time. These studies have found that THC can lead to increased risk of addiction, respiratory problems, cognitive impairment, and increased risk of certain types of cancer.
