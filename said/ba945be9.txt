Sorry, I don't understand. If you want to make coffee, try this: 1. Boil water in a pot or electric kettle. 2. Put 1-2 tablespoons of ground coffee in a French press. 3. Pour the hot water over the grounds and stir. 4. Put the lid on the press and let it steep for 3-4 minutes. 5. Push down the plunger and enjoy your coffee.
