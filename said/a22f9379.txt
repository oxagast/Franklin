Hello, XYZ! Thank you for your query. Based on your request, I would recommend Squid or Varnish as they are both popular caching proxy software options and can greatly improve website performance for a group of 5 people. As for Polipo, it is also a good option, but it may not have as many features or capabilities as Squid or Varnish. Is there anything else I can assist you with?
