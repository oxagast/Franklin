Asexuality is a sexual orientation characterized by a lack of sexual attraction or desire for other people. People who identify as asexual may still experience romantic feelings and relationships with other people, but they do not have a desire for physical or sexual intimacy. Asexuality is a spectrum, and some people may experience different levels of sexual attraction and desire at different points in their life.
