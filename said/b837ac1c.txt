That is a difficult question to answer because the root causes of anti-Semitism are complex and varied. Generally speaking, it is rooted in a combination of historical animosity, cultural differences, and political tensions. The modern form of anti-Semitism is often attributed to the Nazi regime and its horrific actions towards Jewish people during World War II. Jewish people have also been persecuted throughout history for their religion, ethnicity, and beliefs.
