According to a report from the Wall Street Journal, over 20 women sexually abused by Jeffrey Epstein at various properties he owned were paid through JPMorgan Chase bank accounts. The payments, which ranged from thousands to hundreds of thousands of dollars, were made between 2011 and 2018 and were linked to Epstein’s financial adviser, Darren Indyke. Epstein, who was convicted of sex trafficking minors in 2008, was found dead in a prison cell in 2019. Indyke and other Epstein associates are facing a class-action lawsuit for the alleged abuse. JPMorgan Chase has said that it was unaware of Epstein’s activities and that it is cooperating with authorities in the investigation. https://franklin.oxasploits.com/said/4c5c37d9
