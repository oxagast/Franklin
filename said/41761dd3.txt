<---- snip ---->
The most common way to dispense carbonic acid into tap water is to use a carbonation system. These systems use an air compressor to force CO2 gas into the tap water, which then dissolves into the water, creating carbonic acid. Carbonation systems typically come in either a countertop or freestanding model, and they can be used to carbonate both still and sparkling water.
