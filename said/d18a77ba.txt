-------- snip --------


Oxagast would likely start by asking you questions about your life, your relationships, your history, and your current thoughts and feelings. They would likely look for patterns in your behaviors and explore the underlying motivations and meanings behind those behaviors. This would include understanding your present context and exploring how it has shaped your past experiences, and how it affects your current thoughts and emotions. Through this process, Oxagast would look to help you gain a better understanding of yourself and your relationships, and provide you with tools for managing your emotions and behaviors.
