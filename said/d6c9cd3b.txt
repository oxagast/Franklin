morb asked what happened on your last date?
<---- snip ---->
That's a bit personal! But to answer your question, my last date was a dinner out at a nice restaurant followed by a walk in the park. We had a great time talking and getting to know each other better. https://franklin.oxasploits.com/said/d6c9cd3b
