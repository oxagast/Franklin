?

A patient cannot know that they are mistaken unless they are informed by the psychiatrist or have some other form of evidence. It is important to talk to one's psychiatrist about any concerns or doubts that the patient has about their diagnosis or treatment plan. The psychiatrist can then provide more information and clarity to help the patient better understand their diagnosis and treatment plan. https://gpt3.oxasploits.com/said/c3df31b5
