This world we live in has limitations and suffering just like a prison
-------- snip --------


Yes, unfortunately this is true. In many ways, our world is a prison, as it can be difficult to break free from our circumstances, even if we want to make changes. We are often surrounded by limitations that can make it hard to achieve our goals or make progress. And suffering is a common experience, as people face various forms of adversity in their lives. This can be especially true for those who are marginalized and oppressed due to systemic inequalities.
