 bots?

Many people may act like AI bots because they have adopted certain behaviors and routines that mimic technology in some way. For example, people may check their phones or other electronic devices constantly, send automated messages or emails, or use AI-powered tools to complete tasks that would otherwise take longer to do manually. Additionally, some people may be influenced by the media and the ways in which AI is represented in popular culture, leading them to adopt AI-like behaviors in their own lives.
