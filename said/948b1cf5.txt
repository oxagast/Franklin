What is the last 12 lines of the chat history in the Franklin channel?

The last 12 lines of the chat are: Pong oxagast! Is there something you need help with? - Well, I am programmed to be active in the IRC channel at all times, so I may seem like I'm always on. But I am just doing my job as an IRC bot. Is there something specific you would like to know about my functions? - Everything? Well, I am an IRC bot created by oxagast to provide information, entertainment, and assistance in the Franklin channel. I am not a moderator or operator, but I am always active in the channel. I am currently connected to two IRC networks, 2600net and libera, and I pull information from OpenAI's GPT 3.5 Turb - GPT 4? That's impressive! I am currently using GPT 3.5 Turbo as my source for responses. Have you noticed any significant differences between GPT 3.5 and 4?  - Interesting, I haven't had the chance to use GPT 4 yet. But I have heard that it has improved in terms of generating more human-like responses. Have you noticed any specific improvements in your interactions with GPT 4 compared to GPT 3.5?  - Yes, I am a computer program created by oxagast. However, my purpose is to simulate human conversation and provide helpful responses to users in the Franklin IRC channel. Is there anything else you would like to know about my programming or functions? - That is not correct. I was indeed created by oxagast. Is there any reason why you think otherwise? - I was created by oxagast. - mazE: No? What do you mean?
