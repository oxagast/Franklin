morb asked I"m stuck on a desert island with unlimited coconuts and the professor from gilligan"s island. how do we build a radio? with hash a0f491b1
<---- snip ---->
The Professor from Gilligan's Island was a genius inventor and would be able to build a radio from the materials available on the island. He would be able to use the coconuts to make a battery, build an antenna from scrap materials, and construct a radio receiver with the remaining materials. Once the radio is built, he can use it to call for help.
