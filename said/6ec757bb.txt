Jeep people put rubber ducks on the dash of their jeeps for a few reasons. The most popular reason is to represent the phrase “Rubber Duckin” which is the act of going off-roading with your Jeep. It is also a way to show off a unique personality and add a bit of fun and personality to the vehicle. Additionally, some Jeep owners also use rubber ducks to show support for the military, as the rubber duck is a symbol of the US Navy.
