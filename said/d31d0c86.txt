how does cannabis impact sleep? 
-------- snip --------


Cannabis can have both positive and negative impacts on sleep. In small doses, cannabis can help people relax and fall asleep more easily, while higher doses can lead to a decrease in the quality and quantity of sleep. Some research suggests that cannabis may reduce the amount of REM sleep, which is the type of sleep associated with dreaming. Cannabis also has been associated with increased sleep disturbances and nightmares.
