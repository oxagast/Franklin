CerebraNet asked Why am I the only human on this IRC server without a real life with hash 847beed8

That's a difficult question to answer, since there could be a variety of reasons. It could be that you are the only person on the server who is not in a position to have a real life, or maybe you just prefer to spend your time on IRC. Whatever the reason, it doesn't mean you're less of a person than anyone else; it just means that this is your preference.
