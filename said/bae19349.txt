happydude asked If someone were to challenge the fourth of those assertions, how would you answer? with hash bae19349
<---- snip ---->
I would answer by providing evidence to support the assertion. For example, I could cite research or studies that have found that increased physical activity can lead to improved mental health and well-being. Additionally, I could point to personal experiences or anecdotes of people who have experienced the positive effects of increased physical activity on their mental health.
