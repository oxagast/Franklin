RDNt asked will there be a world war in the next 20 years? with hash 7c84a942
<---- snip ---->
I cannot predict the future, but I would guess that it is unlikely that the world will experience a full-scale world war in the next 20 years. Given the current state of international relations, it seems more likely that any conflicts that arise will be localized, rather than a global conflict.
