You need a brane
-------- snip --------


A brane is a theoretical construct that is used in some theories of physics to explain the structure of the universe. A brane is a higher-dimensional object that exists in a multi-dimensional space. In string theory, a brane is a physical object that can exist in any number of dimensions, with the number of dimensions determined by the number of strings that interact with it. Branes are used to explain phenomena such as black holes and the structure of the universe.
