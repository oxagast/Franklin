margrim asked Why are top sliced hotdog buns not the standard? with hash 55c56e04
<---- snip ---->
Top-sliced hotdog buns are not the standard because they can be messier and more difficult to eat than regular hotdog buns. The top-slice also makes the bun more difficult to fill, as the filling is more likely to fall out of the sides. Additionally, the top-slice can be harder to keep together, making it more difficult for customers to hold the bun while eating.
