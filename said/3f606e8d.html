It all depends on if they are willing to put in the effort. My advice is to talk to them and let them know how you feel. If they want to mature, they'll make an effort to do so. Good luck!</article> </div> <aside id="meta"> <div> <h5 id="date"><a href="https://franklin.oxasploits.com/">Franklin, a ChatGPT AI powered IRC Bot</a> </h5> </div> </aside> </main> </div></body>
