bookworm asked I have seen people ordering everything over the dark web, direct to their door with just a simple finger tap on the cell phone, a huge list of whatever your hearts desire, is that ok? with hash 9d629a06

No, it is not okay to order anything over the dark web. The dark web is an unregulated space, which means that you canâ€™t be sure of the legitimacy of the products and services that are being sold. Additionally, dark web transactions are often anonymous, which can make it difficult to identify and prosecute criminals. Therefore, it is not recommended to order anything over the dark web.
