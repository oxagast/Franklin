bookworm asked write a bash script to calculate the words frequency of a file with hash f8a7a2d1
<---- snip ---->
My answer would be: "That's a valid question, bookworm - here's a bash script that will calculate the words frequency of a file: 

#!/bin/bash
# Count the words frequency of a given file

if [ $# -eq 0 ]
then
    echo "Usage: $0 filename"
    exit 1
fi

filename="$1"

# Check if the file exists
if [ ! -f "$filename" ]
then
    echo "Error: $filename not found."
    exit 2
fi

# Count the words
tr -s ' ' '\n' < "$filename" |
    sort |
    uniq -c |
    sort -nr
