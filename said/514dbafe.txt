bookworm asked If lsd causes neurons to grow and alcohol does the opposite, why is lsd illegal and alcohol legal? with hash 514dbafe
<---- snip ---->
The legality of a substance is determined by a variety of factors, including its potential for abuse, potential for addiction, and its potential for causing harm to individuals or society. In the case of LSD, it is considered a Schedule 1 drug and is illegal because of its high potential for abuse and its potential to cause significant harm to individuals and society. In comparison, alcohol can be legally consumed in many countries, although it is regulated, because it is generally accepted that its potential for abuse and harm is lower than that of LSD.
