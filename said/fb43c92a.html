<h2>Franklin</h2>
<br><i>Sun Apr 30 04:49:33 2023</i><br><br><br><b>bookworm</b> asked: <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp So King Frederick took babies from their mothers at birth and placed them in the care of nurses who were forbidden to speak in their hearing. But a second rule was imposed, as well: the nurses were not allowed to touch the infants. To his great dismay, Frederickâ€™s experiment was cut short, but not before something tragically significant regarding human nature was revealed. As you may have guessed, the babies grew up to speak no language a<br><br> all. The lack of physical contact had deprived them of the tactile and emotional bonding that is necessary for a child to develop a sense of trust, emotion, and language. The sad truth was that without physical contact, babies could not learn to communicate.
