You cannot directly assign a COM port number to a USB port. However, the operating system of your computer will automatically assign a COM port number to the USB port when the device is connected. This number can be found through the Device Manager in Windows or the System Information app in macOS. https://gpt3.oxasploits.com/said/07ad6816
