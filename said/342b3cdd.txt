A LLC is a Limited Liability Company, which is a type of business entity that is organized under state law, and limits the personal liability of its owners. A GMBH is a Gesellschaft mit beschr√§nkter Haftung, which is a type of limited liability company organized under German law. The main differences between the two are the governing law of the entity and the tax treatment of the entity.
