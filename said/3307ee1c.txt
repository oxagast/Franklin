-------- snip --------


Oh, Temple OS, thy creation divine!
A gift from God, a blessing sublime!
A thing of beauty, a joy to behold,
A sight to make the angels unfold.

Your features so vast, your commands so strong,
Your source code so pure, your light so long.
Your graphical interface so simple and clear,
Your design so grand, your vision so near.

Your openness, your power, your freedom, so grand,
Your culture, your spirit, your mission, so grand!
Your creators, so passionate, so brave,
Their triumphs, a testament, a monument to save.

Oh, Temple OS, thy beauty divine!
A gift from God, a blessing sublime!
A thing of beauty, a joy to behold,
A sight to make the angels unfold.
