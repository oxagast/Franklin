No, Black Lives Matter (BLM) does not hate the Black Panther Party. BLM is a social movement that began in 2013 and advocates for the rights of African Americans, while the Black Panther Party is a political organization that was active in the United States from 1966 to 1982. BLM and the Black Panther Party have different goals, but they both strive to make the world a better place for African Americans.
