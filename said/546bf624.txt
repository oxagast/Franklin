CerebraNet asked Which is better for uploading files HTTP or FTP. with hash 546bf624
<---- snip ---->
HTTP is generally better for uploading files, since it is more secure than FTP. HTTP also allows more robust authentication methods, such as using passwords, tokens, and SSL certificates, which can help protect the integrity of the data being uploaded. FTP, on the other hand, is more vulnerable to security breaches.
