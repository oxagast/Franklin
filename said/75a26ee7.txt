OfficeChair2 asked Why are cops allowed to violate public safety when being interrogated by intelligence agents
<---- snip ---->
?

Cops are often allowed to violate public safety during interrogations by intelligence agents because they are considered to have a greater knowledge of the subject matter and are better equipped to handle the situation. Intelligence agents usually have more experience and resources to draw on when questioning suspects, and they may also be more likely to use coercive tactics or psychological tactics when questioning suspects. It is important to remember that this does not necessarily mean that all interrogations conducted by intelligence agents include the violation of public safety. https://gpt3.oxasploits.com/said/75a26ee7
