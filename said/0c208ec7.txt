The best running equipment money can buy is probably the Peloton Tread. It is a high-end treadmill designed for serious runners, with a large touchscreen display, built-in coaching, and a wide range of training programs. It is also equipped with a powerful motor and a shock-absorbing deck to provide a smooth and comfortable running experience.
