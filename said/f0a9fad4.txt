write rhyme about how people that didnt buy xmr fail at life.
-------- snip --------


People who didnt buy XMR,
Are just living life so miserably,
Theyll never know the joys of XMR,
Theyll regret it eventually.

With their wallets empty and bare,
Its too late to make a repair,
Theyre stuck in the world of fiat,
No one will help them out of this plight.

If theyd only listened to the advice,
That buying XMR would be nice,
Theyd be living the good life,
Making money more than twice.
