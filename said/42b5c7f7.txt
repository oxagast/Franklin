<---- snip ---->
It is difficult to accurately estimate the total number of video games that contain references or influences from Aum Shinrikyo, as the organization and its activities are not widely featured in most mainstream gaming titles. However, there are some games that have been released which do feature elements of Aum Shinrikyo or its teachings, including the 2014 tactical RPG Shoumetsu Toshi, the PlayStation 4 game Tokyo Chronos, the 2018 visual novel Shoujo Fuguuji, the 2015 visual novel The Silver Case, and the 2019 adventure game Tokyo Dark.
