<---- snip ---->
To freeze vodka at home, you will need a large container, such as a cooler or plastic tub. Fill the container with tap water and add a generous amount of rock salt, stirring it until fully dissolved. Place the vodka bottle into the cooler, making sure it is fully submerged. Leave it in the cooler for about two hours and you should have frozen vodka!
