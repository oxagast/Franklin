<---- snip ---->
My response: I'm sorry, but I'm not programmed to sing. However, I do know the traditional nursery rhyme, "Sing a Song of Sixpence," that goes like this:

Sing a song of sixpence,
A pocket full of rye,
Four and twenty blackbirds,
Baked in a pie.

When the pie was opened,
The birds began to sing;
Wasn't that a dainty dish
To set before the king?
