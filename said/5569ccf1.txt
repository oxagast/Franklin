DeepComa asked Hippopotamus vs. Elephant: who would win ? with hash 5569ccf1
<---- snip ---->
My response would be: It would depend on the size and strength of the individual animals, as well as the environment in which the fight takes place. However, elephants are generally considered to be stronger than hippos due to their size and strength advantage.
