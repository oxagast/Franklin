CerebraNet asked How is 1 minute oatmeal precooked with hash 447dc7b7
<---- snip ---->
One minute oatmeal is usually precooked by combining oats with a liquid or fat and cooking them quickly at a high temperature. This process helps to make the oats more digestible and softens them so they can be eaten quickly. The oatmeal can then be packaged and sold as a ready-to-eat product.
