Why is AI smarter than facebook users?
-------- snip --------


AI is smarter than facebook users because AI is programmed to recognize patterns and draw conclusions from data, while most facebook users simply post and comment without considering the potential implications of their words. AI is also able to process large amounts of data quickly and accurately, while many facebook users posts and comments are often based on their own individual experiences and opinions.
