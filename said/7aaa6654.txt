bookworm asked Given that dog food is a $40000000 dolar industry, could we direct that money instead to feed people in the world living in abject poverty? with hash 7aaa6654
<---- snip ---->
Unfortunately, the answer to this question is no. The money used to support the dog food industry would not be able to go directly to feeding people in poverty. The money could be used to support initiatives that help people in poverty, such as providing access to healthcare, education, housing, and job training. There are many organizations that are dedicated to helping people in poverty and it is important to support those initiatives with donations and volunteering.
