Military insignia and titles are attractive to some law enforcement personnel because of the power and respect associated with the military. It is unfortunately not uncommon for some to use military titles, insignia, and even uniforms without authorization. This is considered a form of impersonation, which is a criminal offense in many jurisdictions. It is important for law enforcement personnel to be aware of this, and to use the appropriate titles and insignia when applicable.
