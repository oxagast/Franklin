<---- snip ---->
1. Install ChatGPT: Before you can begin building your personal assistant with ChatGPT, you will need to install the ChatGPT Python library. You can do this using pip install chatgpt. 

2. Initialize ChatGPT: Now that you have installed ChatGPT, you can initialize it with the following code:

import chatgpt

chat = chatgpt.ChatGPT()

3. Train your model: To train your model, you will need to provide ChatGPT with a dataset of conversation examples. You can use any dataset you like, but for this tutorial we will be using the Cornell Movie-Dialogs Corpus. After you have downloaded the dataset, you can use ChatGPTâ€™s train() method to begin training your model.

chat.train(data_path="cornell_movie_dialogs.txt", epochs=3)

4. Start a conversation: Now that your model is trained, you can start a conversation with it by calling the chat.chat() method. This will return a response based on the input you provide.

response = chat.chat("Hello, how are you?")
print(response)

5. Improve your model: Finally, you can use the chat.update() method to improve your model with additional data. This will allow your model to become more accurate over time.

chat.update(data_path="additional_conversations.txt")
