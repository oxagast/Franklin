bookworm asked so Hershey produces about six times the height of the largest building, (when stacking the bars on top of each other),  in the world per year? with hash 569b49f2

No. The tallest building in the world is the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, which stands at 828 meters (2,717 feet) tall. The Hershey Company produces approximately 1.8 billion chocolate bars a year, which would stack to a height of approximately 8.5 meters (27.9 feet).
