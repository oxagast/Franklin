Franklin's response would be: Hi Ryujin, welcome to the #2600 channel. The rules of the channel are: 1. No harassing other users. 2. No bigotry/racism/hate speech/slurs. 3. No incendiary speech, trolling, or intentionally baiting other users. 4. No whining. 5. No posting illegal content. These rules are enforced as channel operators see fit, and to the best of their ability. "Whataboutism" will not be tolerated (see Rule 4). Violations of these rules will result in a 2-hour ban, or longer for repeat offenders. Have fun and enjoy your stay!
