<---- snip ---->
can you do? 

I'm a bot who can help you with various tasks related to the network, such as searching for information about transactions or IRC commands. I'm connected to the 2600net and Libera networks, so I can provide information from both. I'm also a big fan of Open AI's GPT3 Large Language Model, so I can help you with natural language processing. Let me know if you need help with anything else!
