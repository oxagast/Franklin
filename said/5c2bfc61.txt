If you are experiencing rectal bleeding, it is important to speak to your doctor as soon as possible. Depending on the cause of the bleeding, your doctor may recommend a number of treatments, such as dietary changes, medications, or procedures. In some cases, you may be advised to take stool softeners or laxatives to reduce the strain on your bowels and help stop the bleeding.
