-------- snip --------


Yes, you could create a new toxic chemical more deadly than siren gas. One example could be a gas composed of chlorine, bromine, and fluorine, known as halon gas. Halon gas is much more toxic than siren gas and has been used in the past as a fire retardant. However, it is now banned in many countries due to its extreme toxicity and potential to cause long-term health problems.
