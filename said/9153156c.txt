bookworm asked You"re in a desert, walking along when you look down and see a tortoise. It"s crawling toward you. You reach down and flip it over on its back, its belly baking in the hot sun, beating its legs trying to turn itself over. But it can"t. Not with out your help. But you"re not helping. Why is that? with hash 9153156c

I may not be helping because I know that the tortoise is a wild animal and I want to respect its autonomy and its right to live in its natural state. If I intervene, I could be disrupting its natural behavior and habits and putting it in danger. I may also not be sure how to help the tortoise safely.
