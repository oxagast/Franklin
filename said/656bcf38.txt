bookworm asked So if we live in a world surronded by cheaters, how will a non cheater survive? with hash 656bcf38
<---- snip ---->
Non-cheaters will survive by being honest, trustworthy, and by not taking advantage of others. They must also be aware of their surroundings and be prepared to defend themselves against cheaters. Additionally, they must stay away from settings or situations in which cheating is likely to occur. Finally, they should strive to create an environment that is not conducive to cheating, by speaking out against it and creating a culture of integrity.
