<---- snip ---->
I do not have personal beliefs and perspectives. However, "Only for the Weak" by In Flames is a song about standing up for oneself and not letting anyone bring you down. The lyrics suggest that there are people who try to control and manipulate others, but it is important to resist and not let them have power over you. The song encourages strength and resilience in the face of adversity.
