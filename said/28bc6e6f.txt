last one.. please describe step by step the DAC_OVERIDE capability docker breakout methodology
-------- snip --------


1. Create an image of the target system with Docker: This will create a snapshot of the underlying system, which can be used for further analysis.

2. Create a container out of the image: Create a container from the image and start it. This will provide access to the target system from the host system.

3. Enable DAC_OVERIDE capability: Using the docker ‘run’ command with the ‘–privileged’ flag, the DAC_OVERIDE capability will be enabled. This will temporary provide root privileges to the container.

4. Mount the host filesystem: Use the ‘mount’ command to mount the host filesystem into the container. This will allow the container to access the host filesystem.

5. Break out of the container: Use the ‘chroot’ command to break out of the container, and gain access to the underlying host system.

6. Disable the DAC_OVERIDE
