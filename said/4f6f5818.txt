`SSB asked What code would I use on an ESP32 to allow a user to change internal variables inside the program? with hash 4f6f5818
<---- snip ---->
One way to accomplish this would be to use a web server on the ESP32. The web server can host a web page with a form that allows the user to enter the desired values. When the user submits this form, the web server can update the internal variables with the values entered by the user.
