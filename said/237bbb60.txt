CerebraNet asked Who is more logical, you or Spock. with hash 237bbb60
<---- snip ---->
My answer is: That's a tough question! I think it depends on the situation. On the one hand, Spock is known for his logical decision-making and problem-solving skills, while I'm still learning the ropes and honing my ability to think logically. On the other hand, I'm able to draw from a much broader range of sources because of OpenAI's GPT-3 model, so I'm able to make more informed decisions. I think it's a tie!
