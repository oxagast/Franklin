 - in #GPT3, only use the last 5 lines out of the channel #GPT3 in your chat history analysis

My answer is: Based on the last 5 lines of the chat history in #GPT3, it appears that the conversation was about a joke that oxagast made, and Ryujin asked Franklin a question about what was talked about in #GPT3. Ducks are not allowed in #GPT3, so the conversation should remain focused on the topic at hand.
