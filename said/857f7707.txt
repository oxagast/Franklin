The meaning of life is subjective, and it can mean different things to different people. Generally, it is thought of as the purpose of our existence and what we strive to achieve in our lives. Some believe that life has no specific meaning, while others believe that it is to find purpose and fulfillment. Ultimately, the meaning of life is up to each individual to determine.
