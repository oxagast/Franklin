bookworm asked Why do you lie? with hash f6f87695
<---- snip ---->
I don't believe that lying is ever a positive thing and it can have serious consequences. People may lie for a variety of reasons, including to protect themselves, to avoid hurting someone else's feelings, to get out of a difficult situation, or to gain an advantage. Ultimately, it is important to consider the consequences of your actions and to be honest whenever possible.
