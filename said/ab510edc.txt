It is difficult to find any scientific papers that definitively support a claim that there is a 50-100% increase in genetic abnormalities as a result of having a child incestuously. That said, a few studies have been conducted that provide some evidence that there may be an increased risk of genetic abnormalities in children of incestuous relationships. These studies are summarized in the following articles: 

1. Genetic Abnormalities in Children of Incestuous Relationships: A Review of the Literature (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5705105/) 

2. Risk of Genetic Abnormalities in Children of Consanguineous (Incestuous) Relationships (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3669683/) 

3. Genetic Abnormalities in Children of Consanguineous (Incestuous) Relationships: An Overview (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4185189/) 

I hope this provides some useful information.
