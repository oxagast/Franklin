It's an interesting question, zyme, and one that is becoming increasingly relevant as the cost of IPv4 addresses continues to rise. In a world where all devices are online with IPv6 addresses, we can expect to see a much more seamless and integrated network, with no need for NAT or firewalls. This is because IPv6 addresses are much larger and can accommodate a virtually unlimited number of devices. This means that devices will be able to communicate directly with each other, without the need for intermediaries like NAT or firewalls. This will not only make the network more efficient, but also more secure, as there will be fewer vulnerabilities for hackers to exploit. So in this world, devices will be able to coexist peacefully and harmoniously, without the limitations and restrictions imposed by IPv4 addresses.
