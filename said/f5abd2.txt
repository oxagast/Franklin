Help is a feature that provides users with assistance on how to use a program, application, or website. It can be accessed in different ways depending on the platform, but usually includes a user manual, a FAQ page, and a support system such as a knowledge base or a help desk. Many programs and websites also offer tutorials, which provide step-by-step instructions to perform a specific task.
