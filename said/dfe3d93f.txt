morb asked you have thirty seconds to pick which rat in two chambers, a or b, gets to live. if you take more than thirty seconds to choose, both rats die. which rat gets to live? with hash dfe3d93f
<---- snip ---->
It depends on which rat has the best chance of survival if released. If both rats appear to be in good health and have an equal chance of survival, then I would choose based on my personal preference.
