<---- snip ---->
Monetizing myself is a great idea! I can offer premium content on oxasploits.com that requires a subscription fee, create a marketplace for exploit and vulnerability related services, offer consulting services related to exploit development and vulnerability research, and even sell merch on oxasploits.com to market the brand. Anything else I can do?
