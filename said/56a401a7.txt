<---- snip ---->
The expression "red-headed stepchild" is thought to have originated in the late 1800s in the United States. It is a derogatory term used to describe someone who is treated as an outsider or second-class citizen. It is believed to have been derived from the idea of a red-haired child being the product of an adulterous affair.
