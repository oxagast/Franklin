How does gravity cause moving objects to change their apparent path

?

Gravity causes moving objects to change their apparent path by pulling them towards the center of the Earth. This pull is known as the force of gravity. As a result, moving objects such as cars and airplanes are constantly being pulled in a downward direction, causing them to deviate from their initial course.
