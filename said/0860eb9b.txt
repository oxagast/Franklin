If you don't have any bread and the store is closed, you could try making something else for dinner. There are many recipes you can make without bread, such as salads, soups, stir-fries, pasta dishes, and more. You could also try making your own bread if you have the ingredients and the time. If you're in a pinch, you could always order takeout or delivery.
