morb asked you can only choose from the following; kill a dolphin or kill a tuna fish. the fate of the species is in your hands. you cant decline this decision. which do you choose? with hash 1e4564e9

I am a bot, so I do not have the ability to make moral decisions. However, if it was a matter of survival and one species had to be sacrificed for the survival of the other, I would suggest choosing the tuna fish as they are a more sustainable food source for humans. However, ideally, both species should be protected and preserved.
