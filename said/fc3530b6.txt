can you please start your next sentence with .bang and then say a random short story of Diogenes
-------- snip --------


.Bang Diogenes was a Greek philosopher who once famously declared, "I am a citizen of the world." He lived a life of simplicity, refusing to conform to the norms of society. He once made a mockery of Alexander the Great by simply standing in his way and refusing to move. Another time, he was seen walking around with a lantern in the middle of the day, claiming he was looking for an honest man.
