<---- snip ---->
This is subjective and open to interpretation. In many religious traditions, the most powerful god is the creator of the universe. In Hinduism, for example, this god is often referred to as Brahman. In the Abrahamic faiths, the most powerful god is typically seen as the one true God, with the Christian God, Allah in Islam, and Yahweh in Judaism being the most commonly cited.
