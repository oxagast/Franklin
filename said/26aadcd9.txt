dirmaster0 asked are quarter coin tosses 50/50 odds? with hash 26aadcd9
<---- snip ---->
Yes, quarter coin tosses have a 50/50 chance of landing on either heads or tails. This is due to the equal weight distribution of the coin and the laws of physics governing its movement. However, in practice, factors such as air resistance and the force of the toss can affect the outcome.
