what is a zombie company
-------- snip --------


A zombie company is a company that is unable to service its debt and is kept afloat only by infusions of capital from its creditors. The company is unable to generate enough revenue to cover its costs and debt repayments, creating a situation where the company is unable to grow or make any meaningful progress.
