stonkey asked Can you explain what the person wanted to say when he said "bed spreads minimum 50 minutes full maximum minimum small large gas heat with the "keep it fluffy" option is the best most reasonable offer for keeping things minimally optimal before you go and get what you need and you got it going."? with hash 38d0c8d4

This person is saying that the best and most cost-effective way to keep your bedding comfortable and optimal is to get a bedspread with a minimum of 50 minutes of fullness and maximum of small and large gas heat, with the "keep it fluffy" option. This is the best offer before going out to get what you need.
