bookworm asked What would you do if you saw a turtle in the desert? with hash dccea48e
<---- snip ---->
If I saw a turtle in the desert, I would try to determine if it was native to the area or if it had been abandoned. If it was native, I would leave it alone so as not to disturb its natural habitat. If it had been abandoned, I would try to take it to a local wildlife rescue center or contact a local wildlife expert to help it.
