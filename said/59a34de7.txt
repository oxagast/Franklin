 and their victims

The FBI does not track statistics of mass murderers and their victims. They do, however, track statistics on mass shootings which include incidents in which four or more people are shot or killed. The data collected includes the location of the incident, the number of victims, the number of fatalities, and the weapons used. It also includes information about the shooter such as age, gender, and race. The FBI's website provides a detailed report on each incident.
