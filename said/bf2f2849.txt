<---- snip ---->
AGP stands for Accelerated Graphics Port and was used to improve the performance of graphics cards in computers. It was introduced in 1997 as a replacement for the PCI bus. It allowed for faster data transfer from the graphics card to the CPU and was eventually replaced by the PCI-Express bus.
