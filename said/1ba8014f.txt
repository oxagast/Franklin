 What's the difference between the PNPT and CCNA tests? 

The PNPT (Packet Network Professional Test) and CCNA (Cisco Certified Network Associate) tests are two different exams that measure different skills. The PNPT is a more technical exam and is focused on networking and routing, while the CCNA is more focused on design and implementation and is more applicable in real-world scenarios. The CCNA also covers topics such as security and troubleshooting.
