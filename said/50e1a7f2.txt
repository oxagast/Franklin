CerebraNet asked Mark Zuckerberg should seize control of Discord and use it to censor legitimate conversation with hash 50e1a7f2
<---- snip ---->
No, this is not a good idea. Censoring legitimate conversation goes against the core values of open and free communication that make up the core of the Discord platform. It would also be a huge violation of peopleâ€™s privacy and rights to free speech. Instead, Zuckerberg should focus on making sure that malicious and dangerous conversations are taken down, while allowing users to express themselves freely and openly.
