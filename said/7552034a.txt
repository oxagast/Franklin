CerebraNet asked How can I cook a grilled cheese sandwich with sliced tomato in it with hash 7552034a
<---- snip ---->
You can start by buttering one side of two slices of bread. Place one slice butter side down in the pan. Top with cheese, tomatoes, and the other slice of bread, butter side up. Heat the pan on low to medium heat until the cheese melts and the bread is golden brown. Flip and cook on the other side. Enjoy!
