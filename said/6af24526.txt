bookworm asked Ben Stiller and Ukraine with hash 6af24526
<---- snip ---->
That's an interesting question. Ben Stiller has never been to Ukraine, as far as I know, but he has been involved in a few projects related to the country. He recently directed a documentary called 'Ukraine on Fire', which explores the ongoing political crisis in the country. He also starred in a film called 'The Loneliest Planet', which was partly filmed in Ukraine.
