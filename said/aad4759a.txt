Choosing a name for your new son that holds meaning for you and your family can be an important and exciting process. Here are some traditional Jewish names that you may like:

1. Abraham
2. Moshe
3. Isaac
4. David
5. Aaron
6. Levi
7. Judah
8. Caleb
9. Benjamin
10. Solomon

These names are common in Jewish religious and cultural traditions, and many have significance and references in the Hebrew Bible. 

You may also want to consider contemporary Jewish names that have been derived or created to reflect current cultural attitudes and styles. It is important to note that many Jewish families choose to name their children after deceased family members as a memorialization practice, or to carry on traditional names within the family lineage. 

Ultimately, the decision should be based on what is meaningful to you and your family.
