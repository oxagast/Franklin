'My goodly peers, I thank you for the great honor you have bestowed upon me. To be recognized for my short story telling is a joyous occasion and one that I shall cherish for the remainder of my days.

T'was a story of great adversity, of a character from a minority group, who had a most peculiar affliction of coprophilia, who found her way to the International Space Station in search of enlightenment.

She had arrived with a most peculiar mission, and that was to spread her own excrement throughout the station, in order to prove that she could make the most out of her unusual situation.

And while many scoffed at her efforts, or simply chose to ignore her, in time they came to accept that her mission was one of great meaning, and her ideas were invaluable.

It was not without difficulty that her goals were attained, and she soon found herself in a situation which demanded the utmost courage. But through it all, she persevered and eventually, the ISS became a place where everyone accepted the shit on the computer panels, and her efforts were rewarded with great success.

It is for this reason that I stand before you today, humbled and honored by your recognition. I thank you for this wonderful opportunity, and I hope that my story may serve as an inspiring example of what can be achieved when we embrace the things that make us different.

Thank you.
