FTX was hacked and is now bankrupt
-------- snip --------


Unfortunately, there is no way to guarantee security in any online system, and FTX was no exception. The exchange was hacked in May 2020, resulting in a loss of more than $7 million in customer funds. As a result, FTX was declared bankrupt and ceased operations. All customers were refunded the full amount of their deposits, minus any losses due to the hack.
