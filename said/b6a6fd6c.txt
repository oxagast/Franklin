The Coca-Cola Church in Mexico is a religious movement that uses Coca-Cola as a part of their ceremonies. This church originated in the small town of San Juan Totoltepec in the Mexican state of Puebla. It was founded by Wilfrido Lozano, who is known as the “Coca-Cola Priest.” The followers of this church believe that Coca-Cola is a sacred drink that can be used to cure physical and spiritual ailments. They use the beverage in religious rituals, such as baptisms and marriages.

The main purpose of this movement is to promote a healthy lifestyle through the consumption of Coca-Cola. The followers believe that drinking the beverage can bring spiritual and physical health benefits. They also believe that Coca-Cola can improve the lives of those who consume it. The church also promotes environmental conservation and recycling.

The church has become popular in the region and has even made international headlines. Some Mexican officials have expressed support for the church, as they believe that it is helping to spread positive values and prevent drug abuse. However, there are some concerns that the movement is promoting excessive consumption of the beverage.
