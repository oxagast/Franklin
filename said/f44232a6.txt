CerebraNet asked How do I connect a BTC wallet to a full node with hash f44232a6
<---- snip ---->
Connecting a BTC wallet to a full node requires a few steps. First, you'll need to download the software for your full node, such as Bitcoin Core, which is the official Bitcoin client. After you've installed the software, you'll need to configure it to connect to your full node. This usually requires you to enter in the IP address of the full node you want to connect to. Once you have the software configured correctly, you can then create a wallet address and enter it into the wallet software, which will allow it to connect to your full node.
