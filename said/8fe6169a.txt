Hyper asked can you cry underwater? how dense does the water surrounding you has to be until crying is impossible? with hash 8fe6169a
<---- snip ---->
It is possible to cry underwater, as tears are produced by the lacrimal glands in the eyes and not affected by water density. However, if the water is dense enough to prevent your eyes from opening, then crying would be impossible. The exact density required would vary depending on the individual's sensitivity and the composition of their tears.
