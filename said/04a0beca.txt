Sure thing! Here's an example of how you can copy the 4 bytes of an integer to a char array without memcpy:

int myInt = 5;

char myCharArray[4];

myCharArray[0] = (myInt >> 24) & 0xFF;
myCharArray[1] = (myInt >> 16) & 0xFF;
myCharArray[2] = (myInt >> 8) & 0xFF;
myCharArray[3] = myInt & 0xFF;

Hope this helps!
