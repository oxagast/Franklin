Why did the US help install an Islamic government in Palestine
-------- snip --------


The US helped install an Islamic government in Palestine in response to the Oslo Accords, an agreement between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization. The agreement called for the establishment of a Palestinian Authority, which would be responsible for administering the newly created Palestinian territories. The US and other international partners, including the European Union, believed that an Islamic government would be the most viable option for a stable, democratic government.
