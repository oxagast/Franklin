bookworm asked What happens when you fart? with hash 1fe907ed
<---- snip ---->
My response: Farts are the result of the digestive process. They are the body's way of releasing gases like nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and methane. Farting is a perfectly normal part of life, so don't be embarrassed about it!
