dclaw asked how do you draw a hendecagram with hash f7898e12
<---- snip ---->
1. Start by drawing a circle.
2. Divide the circle into 11 equal sections by imagining 11 lines radiating out from the center.
3. Mark the intersections of the lines with points.
4. Connect the points with straight lines to form the hendecagram.
