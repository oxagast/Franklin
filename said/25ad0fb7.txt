No, we cannot make this deduction based on the information provided. While it is possible that the war in Ukraine is being used to funnel capital for military profit, more information is needed in order to make this conclusion. This could include information about the motivations of the various parties involved, the geopolitical context of the conflict, the economic interests at stake, etc.
