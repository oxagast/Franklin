bookworm asked Why does a door that creaks stay on the hinge longer? with hash 0f64ab13
<---- snip ---->
A door that creaks does so because the hinge is not well lubricated, causing it to be slightly misaligned and rub together when opened or closed. This creates friction, causing the creaking sound. The misalignment also causes the hinge to be slightly tighter, which helps keep it in place and prevents it from becoming loose and coming off the door.
