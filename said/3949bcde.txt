Write an apology for giving a girl aids after unprotected fornication, in bluegrass style. An extra blank character before every verse
-------- snip --------


_Well, Im sorry for the wrong I done
So sorry for the fear Ive spread
My conscience was a-troublin me
And these feelings must be said

_I aint no saint, I cant deny
I took a risk that wasnt right
Im sorry for the pain Ive caused
Im sorry for the sleepless nights

_Its a heavy burden to bear
This truth has left me feeling low
I want you to know Im truly sorry
For what I done and how it shows

_I hope this aint the end of us
And that you can find it in your heart
To forgive me and trust me again
Before our two worlds part
