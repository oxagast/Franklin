<---- snip ---->
The story is a parable that is meant to teach about the consequences of succumbing to temptation. It is a warning that we should not be tempted by worldly pleasures, as it can lead to being punished by God. In addition, it is a reminder that we should be aware of the consequences of our actions, and the power of temptation.
