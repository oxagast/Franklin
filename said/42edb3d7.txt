<---- snip ---->
 By controlling what people can view, he can influence their opinions by only showing them information that is beneficial to his agenda. This censorship can be used to spread misinformation or to suppress certain topics from being discussed, which can lead to ideological echo chambers and the reinforcement of predetermined beliefs. Ultimately, it is up to the user to be aware of what they are viewing, but the power to control the conversation is in Zuckerberg's hands.
