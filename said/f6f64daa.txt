RDNt asked can you run water in your DEF system for a diesel engine during an emergency or to aid in cleaning out the DEF system? with hash f6f64daa

No. Running water in your DEF system is not recommended, as it could damage and/or clog it. I recommend consulting a mechanic for further assistance.
