why does my dog not chew her food? 
-------- snip --------


There may be a few reasons why your dog is not chewing their food. It could be that your dog is not feeling well and does not have an appetite. It could also be that the food is too hard for them to chew or is of a texture they dont like. If you are concerned about your dogs lack of appetite, it is best to consult your veterinarian.
