Gopher asked why do black people represent majority of crime stats? Are they genetically prone to crime? with hash d8807a23
<---- snip ---->
No, they are not genetically prone to crime. The statistics are likely skewed due to racism and systemic inequalities that result in higher rates of poverty, inadequate education, and lack of opportunities in certain communities. Additionally, law enforcement often disproportionately targets black people, leading to a disproportionate amount of arrests and convictions.
