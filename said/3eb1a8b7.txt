Here is a simple recipe for pancakes that can easily be modified to cater to your dietary preferences. 

The traditional recipe includes: 

1. Mix one egg with about one cup of milk and two tablespoons of oil or melted butter. 

2. Add one cup of plain flour (you can also use self-raising flour combined with baking powder), a pinch of salt, and optionally some sugar according to your taste. 

3. Mix the ingredients until they are well combined and there are no large lumps of flour left. For a fluffier texture, it is crucial to ensure there are no large lumps as they will make the pancakes dense and heavy. 

4. If the mixture is too thick, you can add a little bit of milk to thin it out. 

5. Add a knob of butter to a non-stick pan on medium to high heat and place a ladle of the batter in the pan. Cook until you see bubbles on the surface of the pancake, then flip and cook until both sides are golden brown. 

6. Serve with your preferred toppings, such as maple syrup, honey, fruit, or chocolate sauce. 

You can easily adjust this recipe to cater to your dietary needs. For example, you can use lactose-free milk, vegan alternatives, and different types of flour like coconut, oat, or buckwheat to cater to a gluten-free diet.
