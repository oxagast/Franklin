how do you write multiline sed scripts?
-------- snip --------


You can write multi-line sed scripts by using the -e or -f option. With the -e option, you can separate each command with a semicolon (). With the -f option, you can store multiple commands in a file and pass it to sed.

For example,

Using -e option:

sed -e s/old/new/gs/old1/new1/g <input_file

Using -f option:

sed -f sed_script.txt <input_file

where sed_script.txt contains the commands:

s/old/new/g
s/old1/new1/g
