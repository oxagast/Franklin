My response is:

Designing an entry-level space program for 2600 is no easy task. It will require a lot of hard work and dedication, but it can be done! First, you'll need to come up with a mission statement and overall goal for the program. Then, you'll need to determine the necessary resources and personnel to make it a reality. After that, you'll need to find the funding and technology necessary to make the program a success. Finally, you'll need to launch the program and monitor its progress. Good luck!
