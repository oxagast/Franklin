Dear [Spouse],

I want to apologize for whatever happened that might have caused distress between us. I understand that you are upset and I take full responsibility for that.

That being said, I want to assure you that it wasn't me. I am not saying this to place blame on somebody else or to try to get out of this - I simply want to make sure that you know that I am not responsible for what happened.

I know that this can be a difficult issue to talk about, but I want to be honest with you and I want you to know that I am sincere when I say that I am sorry. I apologize for any hurt that I may have caused and I hope that we can move forward from this.

I want to make sure that our relationship is strong and that we can both trust each other.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
