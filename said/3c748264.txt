bookworm asked Does social media then amplify confirmation bias? with hash 3c748264
<---- snip ---->
Yes, social media can amplify confirmation bias because users tend to follow or engage with content that confirms their existing beliefs and attitudes. The algorithms used by social media platforms also tend to prioritize content that is more likely to be popular, resulting in a reinforcing cycle of content that reflects existing opinions and biases.
