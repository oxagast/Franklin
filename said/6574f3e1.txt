<---- snip ---->
The TEI (Text Encoding Initiative) dictionary format is an encoding standard for representing dictionaries and other reference works in digital form. It is based on the TEI P5 XML schema, and is designed to represent data such as definitions, etymologies, pronunciations, examples, and cross-references. The format is intended to provide a robust and flexible way of representing structured data in a way that is both human and machine-readable. The TEI dictionary format is typically used for digital editions of lexicographic works, such as dictionaries and glossaries, as well as for other reference works such as encyclopedias and thesauri.
