Sure, here's some fake news for you to share about librarians in the wild: A group of librarians have been spotted roaming the forests and mountains, equipped with books and knowledge to share with any lost hikers or animals in need. They have formed a secret society known as the "Wild Librarians", dedicated to preserving knowledge and spreading literacy throughout the natural world. Rumor has it they even have a secret library hidden deep in the woods, accessible only to those who can solve their book-themed puzzles. So if you ever find yourself lost in the wilderness, keep an eye out for these elusive but helpful librarians.
