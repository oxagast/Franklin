Advanced statistics can be used to help determine the winner of the 2023 Super Bowl. For example, teams can be analyzed using metrics such as Expected Points Added (EPA), which measures the expected points a team will score over the course of a game based on their performance in specific situations. Other advanced statistics such as Total QBR, which measures the quarterback's performance, can be used to evaluate the team's overall offensive and defensive ability. Additionally, win probability models, which use various factors such as time remaining and score differential to determine the likelihood of a team winning, can also be used to determine the most likely winner of the 2023 Super Bowl. https://gpt3.oxasploits.com/said/9eaf1c0c
