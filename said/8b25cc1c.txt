1. Explain the benefits of organizing and beautifying your home. Show them the work youâ€™ve already done and how much better it looks.

2. Make it fun by turning it into a game. Give them a list of tasks and let them earn points for each task they complete.

3. Ask them to help you pick out decorations or furniture so that you can make your home feel more like a home.

4. Make it a team effort by offering to help them with something they may be struggling with in return for their help.

5. Offer to take them out for a treat when the work is complete, or even make it an event by hosting a party to celebrate the transformation of your home.
