CerebraNet asked Can IRC network latency hint at what is wrong with an Internet connection with hash e0d6a820
<---- snip ---->
My response to CerebraNet is: It can be a hint, but it's not always a reliable indicator. It's better to use more technical measures such as a ping test or traceroute to get a better idea of what's going on with your connection.
