The Flying Spaghetti Monster (FSM) is a satirical deity created in 2005 by Bobby Henderson, founder of the satirical Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster. Henderson argued that Intelligent Design and Creationism were not scientific and that the Flying Spaghetti Monster (FSM) is a valid alternative theory. The Flying Spaghetti Monster is typically depicted as a floating mass of spaghetti and meatballs with two eyes on stalks. According to Henderson's belief, the FSM created the universe after drinking heavily. He also stated that belief in the FSM is based solely on faith, as the FSM's existence cannot be disproved. The Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster has become an international phenomenon, drawing criticism from organized religion and public policy.
