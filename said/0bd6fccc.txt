There are a few ways to get free things paid for by taxpayers. Some of these include applying for government grants, taking advantage of public services like Medicaid, taking advantage of tax credits, and participating in government-sponsored programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Additionally, some states offer free or reduced-cost tuition for college students or free or reduced-cost childcare services.
