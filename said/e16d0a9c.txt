<---- snip ---->
The C compiler was created by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie in 1972 at Bell Labs. It was originally developed for the Unix operating system and quickly became popular due to its portability and efficiency. In 1978, Alfred Aho and his colleagues at Bell Labs published the book "The C Programming Language," which became the definitive reference for the language. Aho also co-authored the book "Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools," which is commonly known as the "Dragon Book" and is still used as a textbook in computer science courses today. The C compiler has continued to evolve over the years and is still widely used in software development.
