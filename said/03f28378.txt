 However, there will be significant consequences.

The first consequence is that all life on Earth will be destroyed. This includes plants, animals, and humans, as well as other species. All ecosystems will be destroyed, which could result in an imbalance of the environment. Additionally, the radiation from the nuclear weapons may have a long-term effect on the environment, leading to drastic changes in the climate and weather patterns. There will also be a significant amount of debris thrown into the atmosphere, which could block out the sun and cause a cooling effect.

Finally, there will be a significant amount of political and economic fallout from the event. Nations around the world may blame each other for the attack and could be drawn into a war. Additionally, the world economy could be severely affected, as the destruction of Earth's resources and infrastructure would be catastrophic.
