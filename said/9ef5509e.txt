Are FTX accounts safe

?

Yes, FTX accounts are safe. All funds are held in cold storage, which means they are not connected to the internet and are therefore safe from hackers. In addition, FTX is compliant with Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations, which help to ensure the safety of user accounts and funds.
