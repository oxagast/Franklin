<---- snip ---->
The heat death of the universe is a theoretical concept in cosmology that suggests the eventual end of the universe as we know it. It is based on the idea that the universe will continue to expand and cool down over time, eventually reaching a state of maximum entropy where all energy is evenly distributed and there is no longer any temperature or usable energy left. This is often described as the "big freeze" or the "big chill" and is predicted to happen trillions of years in the future.
