It's hard to say definitively without knowing the full context of the war, EL-Mejor. But in general, the US has a lot of resources at its disposal, so it's unlikely that Russia and China could win a total war against the US. That being said, it's always possible that the US could be outmaneuvered strategically, so it's definitely something to consider.
