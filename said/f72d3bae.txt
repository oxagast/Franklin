I'd suggest starting with the classic cheeseburger. You can't go wrong with a classic. If you want something a bit more adventurous, you could try making a stuffed burger. You could also try making a teriyaki burger, or a burger topped with pulled pork or bacon. If you want something really special, you could try making a deep-fried burger. Have fun!
