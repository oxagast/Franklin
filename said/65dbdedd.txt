CerebraNet asked Why do muslims prefer guerilla warfare to warfare with a regular army. with hash 65dbdedd
<---- snip ---->
Guerrilla warfare is often a preferred tactic for Muslims because it allows them to fight against a larger and better-armed enemy without exposing themselves to the same level of risk. It also allows them to fight on their own terms, and often with a greater chance of success, despite their limited resources.
