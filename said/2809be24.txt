CerebraNet asked Why do catholics pretend to drink God"s blood with hash 2809be24
<---- snip ---->
Catholics do not pretend to drink God's blood. In the Catholic Mass, consecrated bread and wine are believed to be transformed into the literal body and blood of Jesus Christ. This is referred to as the doctrine of Transubstantiation. Catholics believe that when they receive Communion, they are partaking in the true body and blood of Christ.
