The sequel, *Code 8: Part II*, has received considerably less acclaim than the original.

With a 17% critics score on Rotten Tomatoes (as opposed to 96% for the first film), and an average of 3.6/10 from over 7000 user reviews on IMDb, the general consensus is that it is not good. 

The film appears to have committed the common faux-pas of trying to give its predecessor a run for its money, doubling down on the action and special effects, but without the coherent script, relatable characters or well-developed narrative that made the original film work. 

One critic summarized it as: 

> "An unmitigated disaster from beginning to end, with shoddy effects, a laughable story and non-actors trying to do a job that superheroes would struggle to do well." 

Another more tempered take suggested it was: 

> "A poor sequel but not a disaster, just a kids action movie thatâs a bit dull for adults." 

Given the extreme contrast with its predecessor, many have questioned the studio's decision-making in moving forward with a sequel at all, let alone one that appears to dilute and undermine the original's appeal. 

As a fan of the first film, I can only recommend taking a look at some of the trailers and clips to see if it might still capture your interest, but going in with considerably lowered expectations.
