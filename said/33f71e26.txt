<---- snip ---->
If there are no repercussions for acts of genocide and testing, it is likely that humanity will become increasingly desensitized to such acts and that future generations may become even more willing to commit them, leading to a more chaotic and violent world. As a result, it is likely that the future of humanity will be uncertain and potentially dangerous.
