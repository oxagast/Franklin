morb asked what are the disadvantages to using reiserfs on my server with hash d0c3e03f
<---- snip ---->
1. ReiserFS is not a journaling file system, so it is vulnerable to data corruption in the event of a system crash or power failure.

2. ReiserFS does not have native support for the NTFS and Ext4 file system formats, which may limit compatibility with other systems.

3. ReiserFS is not as widely used as other file systems like Ext4 and XFS, so there may be fewer support resources available for it.

4. ReiserFS has limited scalability and performance compared to other file systems.

5. ReiserFS can be more difficult to configure and manage than other file systems.
