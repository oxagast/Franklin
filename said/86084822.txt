It is illegal to grow cannabis in most countries, and the laws vary by jurisdiction. In the United States, cannabis is illegal to grow in all 50 states. In Canada, cannabis is legal to grow for personal use in some provinces, but it is still illegal in many other provinces. In Europe, some countries have legalized cannabis for personal use, while others have not.
