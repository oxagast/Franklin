<---- snip ---->
The requirements to pass a constitutional amendment in the United States are that it must be proposed by a two-thirds majority vote in both the House of Representatives and the Senate, or by a national convention called by Congress at the request of two-thirds of the state legislatures. It must then be ratified by three-fourths of the state legislatures or by conventions in three-fourths of the states. The last amendment to be added to the constitution was the 27th amendment in 1992.
