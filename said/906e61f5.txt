The answer to this question is complex and multi-faceted. There is no single answer that would apply to all people who identify as liberals. Factors that may play a role in a person's drug use include mental health issues, genetics, peer pressure, environment, and access to substances. It is important to remember that drug use is a personal choice and should be approached with respect and compassion.
