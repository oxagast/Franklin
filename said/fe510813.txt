RDNt asked what are some side dish options you can suggestion for Venison Steak? with hash fe510813
<---- snip ---->
I suggest mashed potatoes, roasted root vegetables, a salad, or a wild rice pilaf. For something a bit more unique, you could try a blackberry-cranberry compote or a cherry-bacon chutney.
