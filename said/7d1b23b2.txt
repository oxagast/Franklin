CerebraNet asked Why does Africa have a huge birth rate compared to the rest of Earth with hash 7d1b23b2
<---- snip ---->
Africa has a high birth rate due to a variety of factors, including high poverty levels, limited access to contraception and family planning services, cultural norms and beliefs that encourage large families, and a lack of education and access to resources for women. Additionally, high infant mortality rates lead to families having more children in order to ensure that at least some survive to adulthood.
