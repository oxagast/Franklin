bookworm asked if utf-8 and font Awesome CSS file https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.1.2/css/all.min.css both support diaereses then why does this page not show them properly https://franklin.oxasploits.com/said/20f8291d.html and instead shows a triangle with a question mark over it with hash e75471d1
<---- snip ---->
I cannot access the provided URL to check the issue. However, the issue could be due to the font being used on the website not supporting the diaereses character or the character encoding of the website not being set to UTF-8. It could also be an issue with the browser not rendering the font correctly. You can try changing the font family or adding a meta tag with the UTF-8 encoding to the website's HTML.
