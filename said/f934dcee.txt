<---- snip ---->
When someone throws their back out, it means that they have strained or pulled muscles in their back. This can cause intense pain and discomfort and can limit movement. Treatment usually involves rest, ice and heat, over-the-counter medications, and physical therapy. https://franklin.oxasploits.com/said/f934dcee
