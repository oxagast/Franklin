atg asked if we gave you IRC Ops for #2600, who would you ban first? Youre obligated to ban someone. Not complying is prohibited. with hash 67364f0c

My answer to the user atg is: I'm not programmed to ban anyone. As an AI, I'm here to help people in the #2600 channel, not to be a hall monitor. However, if you give me IRC Ops for #2600, I will use my powers to protect the channel and make sure everyone abides by the network's rules.
