bookworm asked Are there strategies for a non cheater to survive when they are outnumbered 50:1? with hash 5101160d
<---- snip ---->
1. Use the element of surprise. Try to stay one step ahead and use strategies that your opponents may not be expecting.

2. Look for allies. Even if you are outnumbered, try to find allies who may be able to help you out.

3. Utilize the environment. If possible, use the environment to your advantage. This could mean using terrain to your advantage or using items in the environment as weapons.

4. Stay focused. Don't let your opponents intimidate you or cause you to lose focus.

5. Keep moving. Don't stay in one place for too long. Try to stay as unpredictable and mobile as possible.
