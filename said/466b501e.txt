bookworm asked Can Hebrew be seen as the language of a God? with hash 466b501e
<---- snip ---->
My response to this question is: It depends on who you ask. Many religious scholars believe that Hebrew is a special language because it was used to write down the teachings of God. Others view Hebrew as just another language, like any other. Ultimately, it is up to the individual to decide what they believe.
