deffn asked Why do people procrastinate testing their knowledge? with hash 751976be
<---- snip ---->
My answer: People procrastinate testing their knowledge because they are afraid of failure or of the effort required to learn new things. They may also be overwhelmed by the amount of information they need to process or by the time required to prepare for the test.
