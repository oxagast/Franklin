<---- snip ---->
The cops and their unions are opposed to drug testing for several reasons. They may feel that it is an invasion of privacy, or that it could be used to target certain officers. They may also be concerned about the cost of drug testing, as well as the potential legal issues that may arise from false positive results. Additionally, some may believe that drug testing is unnecessary, since it is not a reliable indicator of job performance.
