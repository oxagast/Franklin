CerebraNet asked Why does BLM scream Black Lives Matter at Asians implying that Asian lives do not matter. with hash 1e96c8f5
<---- snip ---->
BLM does not imply that Asian lives do not matter. The Black Lives Matter movement is focused on addressing systemic racism and police brutality against African Americans, and it seeks to bring attention to the disparities between Black and other communities. The movement does not intend to suggest that other lives do not matter. In fact, many activists and supporters of the movement recognize that all lives matter, but that the focus should be on improving the quality of life for Black people and other minority groups.
