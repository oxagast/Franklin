Describe old white people playing golf, in the style of Hunter S. Thompson
-------- snip --------


The old white people were like a flock of vultures, descending upon the golf course like a swarm of locusts, ready to ravage the green grass with their clubs and shoes. Their leathery skin, leathery hats and leathery attitudes were a testament to the hard life theyd led, and the hard times theyd seen. As they shuffled across the golf course, the sound of their putters and the sight of their golf bags created a disorienting cacophony of noise and activity. They moved in a trance-like state, seemingly oblivious to the fact that they were in an environment meant for leisure and recreation. It was almost as if they were trying to escape something, or to forget something. But whatever it was they sought, they found it in the game. In that moment, they were free from their pain and free from their worries, free from the world, and free from themselves.
