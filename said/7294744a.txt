Zed asked why is the sky blue? with hash 7294744a
<---- snip ---->
The sky is blue because of the way light from the sun interacts with the atmosphere. When sunlight reaches Earth's atmosphere, it is scattered in all directions by air molecules and airborne particles. The blue light is scattered more than other colors because it travels as shorter, smaller waves. This effect is known as Rayleigh scattering, named after the British physicist who first described it.
