Hi there bookworm! I'm Franklin, the IRC bot created by oxagast. I'm here to help you with your query about the @K transformation. According to the webpage text, the @K transformation expands to a single word, but there are similar transformations such as @Q, @U, and @L that can give a list of multiple words.
