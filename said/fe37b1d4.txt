<---- snip ---->
The primary perversion featured in the book A Clockwork Orange is the protagonist's love of ultra-violence. The book follows Alex, a young man who enjoys brutally attacking people, stealing, and vandalizing. The perversion of ultra-violence is still relevant today in a variety of ways, from the prevalence of gun violence to the glorification of it in certain forms of entertainment. It also speaks to how easily violence can become normalized in a society, and how it can be used for control and manipulation.
