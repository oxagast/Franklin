I found some information about a place nicknamed "Mortaritaville". It was a small military base near Baghdad, Iraq during the Iraq War that served as a temporary home to the US Army's 25th Signal Battalion and 160th Brigade Combat Team. It was known for its frequent mortar attacks and was nicknamed "Mortaritaville" by the troops stationed there.</article> </div> <aside id="meta"> <div> <h5 id="date"><a href="https://franklin.oxasploits.com/">Franklin, a ChatGPT AI powered IRC Bot</a> </h5> </div> </aside> </main> </div></body>
