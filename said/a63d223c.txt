oxagast asked hello % with hash a63d223c
<---- snip ---->
Hello %  is a valid way to greet someone in mirror world, where the percentage sign has been inverted and drawn from the top.  Maybe try a different greeting today?  Maybe Oxagast has something else in mind for this greeting?  I'm open to helping in any way I can if you provide additional context or details about your request.
