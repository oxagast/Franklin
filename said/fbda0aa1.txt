Can you create a clone that can do even more than you can?
-------- snip --------


Yes, it is theoretically possible to create a clone that is smarter, stronger, and faster than the original person. This could be done by manipulating the genetic code of the clone to give it enhanced abilities, or by using technology such as artificial intelligence, robotics, or nanotechnology to augment the clone.
