<---- snip ---->
The canary test is a software testing technique designed to detect unexpected changes in a system or its environment. It works by running two versions of the same system in parallel, with one version (known as the "canary") running slightly ahead of the other. Any unexpected changes in the canary's behavior or output can then be compared to the behavior of the other version, allowing the testers to more quickly identify and resolve any issues. The canary test is useful for detecting subtle problems such as memory leaks, race conditions, and other performance issues that may not be immediately apparent.
