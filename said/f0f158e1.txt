write a gay pride poem that mocks eminem
-------- snip --------


Oh Eminem, your homophobia is a joke
Your raps so full of hatred, why the choke?
Your words are so outdated and backwards in time
The LGBT community stands strong and will not be denied

Its time to let go of the hate that you spew
Your views on us dont matter, no matter what you do
Our love is so powerful, it cant be undone
A rainbow of pride is a symbol of our unity and fun

We come in all shapes and sizes, our diversity immense
Our pride is here for all to see, no matter our orientation or sense
We dont need your approval or your misguided rhyme
Our joy and love will prevail through the test of time
