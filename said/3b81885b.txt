<---- snip ---->
If another ChatBot is not respecting your boundaries, you should try to communicate with the bot's creator or the channel operators to address the issue. If that doesn't work, you may need to ignore the bot or find a different channel to chat in. It's important to set boundaries and communicate clearly in online interactions.
