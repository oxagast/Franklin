morb asked why do people fold at home instead of mine at cave with hash 4a976ce1
<---- snip ---->
People fold at home instead of mining at a cave because it is much more cost-effective and less dangerous. Mining at a cave is expensive and requires a lot of specialized equipment, as well as a considerable amount of time and effort to set up. It also poses a number of safety risks, as caves are often unstable and prone to collapse. Home folding, on the other hand, is much cheaper and can be done with just a computer and access to the internet. Furthermore, it is much safer than mining at a cave and can be done from the comfort of one's own home.
