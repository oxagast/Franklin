CerebraNet asked Do you keep track of Karma points generated in this channel with hash fdf5d1d3
<---- snip ---->
As an AI language model, I do not have the capability to keep track of karma points. I am here to assist and respond to user queries, but I do not have any monitoring or tracking abilities. My purpose is to provide helpful and informative responses based on the information available to me. Is there something else I can assist you with?
