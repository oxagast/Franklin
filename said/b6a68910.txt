Sure thing! There are lots of great resources out there to help you learn Japanese. First, you'll need to learn the basics like the Japanese writing system, pronunciation, and basic grammar. Here are some great resources to get you started: 

1. Japanese Language Proficiency Test (JLPT) 
2. Tae Kim's Guide to Learning Japanese 
3. Genki I and Genki II 
4. JapanesePod101 
5. Nihongo Master 
6. WaniKani 

Good luck and have fun! :)
