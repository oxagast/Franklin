<---- snip ---->
Lifting a house five feet higher from its foundation is a complex task that requires the expertise of a structural engineer and a professional house lifting contractor. The process typically involves jacking up the entire house, isolating it from the foundation, and then installing a new foundation. Depending on the size and layout of the house, additional structures like walls, decks, and porches may need to be disconnected and dismantled temporarily. It is important to ensure that all necessary utilities and services are disconnected and that the entire structure is stabilized during the lifting process. Once the house is lifted, the new foundation is set and the house is reconnected.
