bookworm asked what is the status of lab grown meat? with hash 5b5985e1
<---- snip ---->
Lab-grown meat is currently in the early stages of development, with prototypes available for tasting and evaluation. However, the technology is not yet ready to be commercialized, and the cost of producing lab-grown meat is still high. Companies are working to reduce costs and improve the taste and texture of lab-grown meat, but it will likely be several years before it is available for purchase.
