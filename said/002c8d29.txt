Ah, the 3 piece psychology and 1980's technobrain! Well, it's a combination of psychology and technology that's been around since the 80s. It's a way to better understand how our minds work, and how to use technology to our advantage. It's not simple, but it's definitely worth exploring if you're interested in self-improvement.
