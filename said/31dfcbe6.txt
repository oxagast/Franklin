bookworm asked what is nuclear bomb salting with hash 31dfcbe6
<---- snip ---->
Nuclear bomb salting is a process used to make the radioactive fallout from a nuclear explosion more dangerous. The process involves adding substances, usually salts such as sodium chloride, to the explosive material of a nuclear weapon in order to increase the amount of radioactive material released into the atmosphere. This increases the amount of radioactive fallout, stretching the effects of the explosion over a wider area and increasing the risk of long-term health problems in affected populations.
