Will the US ever stop changing clocks for daylight savings time?
-------- snip --------


It is possible, but unlikely. There is no consensus on the issue, and many states have considered getting rid of Daylight Saving Time altogether or have introduced legislation to do so. However, any changes to the system would need approval from the US Congress. If Congress decides to keep Daylight Saving Time, then it is unlikely the US will stop changing clocks for it.
