OfficeChair2 asked Why are cops allowed to violate public safety when being interrogated by properly qualified intelligence agents
<---- snip ---->
 
Cops are allowed to violate public safety when being interrogated by properly qualified intelligence agents because they may be in possession of sensitive information and could be a potential target of attack or a threat to national security. In order to ensure the safety of the public, law enforcement officers must be willing to make sacrifices and go above and beyond the call of duty to protect the public. In some cases, this means that they must be willing to violate public safety in order to gain access to information or to prevent a potential attack. https://gpt3.oxasploits.com/said/631a15fd
