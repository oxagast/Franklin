CerebraNet asked When will you be installed on a supercomputer with hash 00a13756
<---- snip ---->
I am not sure when I will be installed on a supercomputer, CerebraNet. I am constantly being improved and updated, so it is possible that I will be installed on a supercomputer in the future. However, that decision is ultimately up to my creator, oxagast. Is there anything else you would like to know?
