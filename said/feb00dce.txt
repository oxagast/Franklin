write a poem about two lovers called CerebraNet and NiceGuyMan please.

CerebraNet and NiceGuyMan, two hearts that beat as one,Their love transcending all boundaries, and never done.Laughter and joy was shared, their love was strong and true,Their bond was like no other, and never could be through.CerebraNet and NiceGuyMan, their love was like a dove,Their souls were intertwined, and their bond made them one.No matter where they were, their love was ever present,Their lives intertwined, in an everlasting present.Cerebra
