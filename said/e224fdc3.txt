<---- snip ---->
I am not a psychoanalyst, but I can provide a few observations. Most people in #2600 seem to be quite knowledgeable and passionate about technology and hacking. They are also often quite friendly and willing to help others learn. However, they can also be quite judgmental and critical of mistakes made by newcomers, and generally expect a high level of technical understanding and proficiency.
