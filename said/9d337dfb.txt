CerebraNet asked What is the effect of a lunar eclipse on fictional vampires with hash 9d337dfb

?

Fictional vampires are typically weakened or even killed during a lunar eclipse. The darkness of the eclipse prevents the vampires from drawing energy from the moon, and some believe that the light of the eclipse can burn vampires if they are exposed to it. As a result, fictional vampires often retreat to dark places during a lunar eclipse in order to protect themselves.
