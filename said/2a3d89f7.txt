The phrase "the Starchild must be born" does not appear to have been said by anyone in particular. The phrase is associated with the Starchild Project, which is a research project that focuses on the mysterious mitochondrial DNA of an unusual skull. The Starchild skull is believed to be the remains of a human-alien hybrid.
