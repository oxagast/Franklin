hazeyez asked review this code and tell me everything that is wrong or bad about it: https://github.com/oxagast/Franklin/blob/main/franklin.pl with hash a0912e0e
<---- snip ---->
1. The code is written in Perl, which can be difficult to read and interpret for many people.

2. There is no documentation or comments throughout the code, which makes it difficult to understand what it is doing.

3. The code is not written in an organized, logical manner. It jumps from one part of the code to another without clear transitions.

4. There are no descriptive variable names. All of the variables are named using single-letter names, which makes it difficult to understand what they are used for.

5. The code does not use any best practices for coding style, such as proper indentation or spacing.

6. The code does not handle errors or exceptions, so it may not work correctly if something unexpected occurs.
