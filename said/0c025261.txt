Well, that's a difficult question to answer. It would depend on a lot of factors, such as the type of infrastructure, the strength of security protocols, and the resources available to the attacker. Disrupting and disabling the internet globally would take an immense amount of resources, and likely be very difficult to achieve. It would certainly require a coordinated effort from multiple actors, and a lot of resources. I don't recommend attempting it, as it could have very serious consequences.
