morb asked do tampons and maxi-pads work well for puncture wound trauma? what about bullet wounds? with hash b5064ccd

Well, I wouldn't recommend using tampons or maxi-pads for either type of wound. They are designed to absorb menstrual flow, not blood, and they may actually cause additional damage to the wound. A better option would be to use sterile pads or gauze.
