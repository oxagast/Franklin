Is nutritional yeast good on pizza
-------- snip --------
?

Yes, nutritional yeast can be used to give a cheesy flavor to pizza. Some people like to sprinkle it over the top after baking, while others like to mix it into the dough before baking. However, it is important to note that nutritional yeast does not melt like cheese does, so it will not provide the same texture.
