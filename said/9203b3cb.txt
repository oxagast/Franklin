Baby Got Back is considered to be a "novelty song", a song that is humorous and often absurdist in its theme. This song gained worldwide popularity and was even banned on many US radio stations for its cheekiness and suggestive lyrics, namely the chorus line "I like big butts and I cannot lie". Due to its parental controversy, the song paved the way for other provocative artists at the time like N.W.A., who also struggled to get radio play yet resonated well with the younger generation.
