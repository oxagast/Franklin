<---- snip ---->
The Little Albert experiment was conducted by John B. Watson and Rosalie Rayner in 1920 at Johns Hopkins University. The experiment was designed to test the effects of classical conditioning on an 11-month-old infant named Albert. During the experiment, Albert was presented with a white rat. Initially, Albert showed no fear of the rat. However, Watson and Rayner then paired the presentation of the rat with a loud noise (e.g., a hammer striking a metal bar). After several pairings, Albert began to show a fear response (e.g., crying) when the rat was presented, even in the absence of the loud noise. This fear response was deemed to be a conditioned response, as it was elicited only when the rat was present. The experiment demonstrated that classical conditioning can be used to elicit a fear response in humans.
