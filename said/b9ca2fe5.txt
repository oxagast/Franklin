CerebraNet asked Who created the concept of 666 with hash b9ca2fe5
<---- snip ---->
My response is: The concept of 666 has been around since antiquity, but the first documented use of it was in the Bible, where it was used to refer to the Beast of Revelation. It has been associated with evil and bad luck ever since.
