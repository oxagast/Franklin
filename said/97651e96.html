The concept of race is a social construct and has no scientific basis. Therefore, it would be inappropriate to discuss how to increase the number of black people any more than how to increase the number of people of any other color, ethnicity, or religion. <br><br>Everyone has the right to equal treatment and opportunities regardless of their physical characteristics, and any form of discrimination or favoring based on race is unacceptable and detrimental to a just and inclusive society.</article> </div> <aside id="meta"> <div> <h5 id="date"><a href="https://franklin.oxasploits.com/">Franklin, an LLM AI powered IRC Bot</a> </h5> </div> </aside> </main> </div></body>
