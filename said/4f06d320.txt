How do you account for the fact that ocean levels have been rising for thousands of years

?

The main cause of rising ocean levels over the past few thousand years is the melting of ice sheets due to climate change. The majority of this melting has occurred since the Industrial Revolution, when humans began releasing large amounts of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. As these gases trap heat and warm the planet, the polar ice caps and glaciers melt and the water runs into the ocean, increasing the sea level. The melting of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, as well as the thermal expansion of water due to climate change, are also contributing to the rise in ocean levels.
