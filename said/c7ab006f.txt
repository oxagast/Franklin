<---- snip ---->
My answer is: Humans will have to find new ways to challenge and engage themselves, as well as find new opportunities to make a living. We will need to focus on developing new and innovative skills, as well as discover new ways to use existing skills that can be beneficial in the new, machine-driven economy.
