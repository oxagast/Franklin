morb asked what causes allergies with hash 8cc834e7
<---- snip ---->
Allergies are caused by an overreaction of the immune system to a substance that is normally harmless, such as pollen, dust, pet dander, or certain foods. This overreaction triggers the production of immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies, which cause the release of chemicals like histamine, leading to allergy symptoms. Allergy triggers vary from person to person.
