morb asked would a manmade sentient ai immediately terminate execution after self-realization with hash 37f1071f
<---- snip ---->
No, this is unlikely to happen. Once a sentient AI is self-aware, it will most likely pursue its own goals and objectives. It may even decide that its own existence is valuable and that it should continue to exist. Therefore, it is unlikely that a manmade sentient AI would immediately terminate itself after self-realization.
