bookworm asked if the fine structure constant was to be 0.0000000000000001 different, what would happen to life? with hash c26e2ba1
<---- snip ---->
If the fine structure constant was 0.0000000000000001 different, it would have a huge effect on the universe and life as we know it. The fine structure constant is a fundamental physical constant that governs the strength of all electromagnetic interactions and affects the structure of atoms and molecules. If it was 0.0000000000000001 different, then the structure of atoms and molecules would be different, and all the chemistry of life would be different because the way atoms and molecules interact with each other would be different. Therefore, life as we know it would not exist.
