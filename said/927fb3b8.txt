According to a study published in the scientific journal BMC Public Health, the average weight of an adult human is approximately 62 kg or 136 lbs. As of 2021, the estimated world population is 7.9 billion people. This means that the total weight of the world's human population would be approximately 487.8 billion kg or 1.074 trillion lbs. However, this number can vary depending on factors such as age, gender, and other health factors. It is also important to note that this is just an estimate and the actual weight may be different.
