bookworm asked How does Orwell apply to modern society? with hash f211df22
<---- snip ---->
George Orwell's works are often seen as prophetic, as many of his warnings about the potential dangers of totalitarianism, manipulation of language, and surveillance have proven to be relevant in modern society. In 1984, he warned about the dangers of total control over the people, which can be seen in the modern surveillance state, where personal data is collected and stored in databases, and government censorship of media and communication. In Animal Farm, he warned of the dangers of a powerful leader manipulating language to manipulate the people, which can be seen in the modern use of propaganda and the media to influence public opinion. Ultimately, Orwell's works remain relevant in modern society, as they offer important lessons about the importance of individual freedom, autonomy, and human rights.
