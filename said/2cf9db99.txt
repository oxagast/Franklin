morb asked what makes copper so attractive to anaerobic environments with hash 2cf9db99
<---- snip ---->
Copper is a very stable metal, making it an ideal material for use in anaerobic environments. Its stability makes it resistant to corrosion, which helps to protect the environment from contamination. Copper also has natural antimicrobial properties, which can help to reduce the risk of infection in an anaerobic environment. Additionally, copper is an excellent electrical conductor, making it suitable for use in wiring and electrical equipment. Finally, copper is relatively inexpensive compared to other metals, making it an attractive option for use in anaerobic environments.
