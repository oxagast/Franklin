zyme asked What is the difference between metoprolol succinate and tartrate? with hash ce965444
<---- snip ---->
Metoprolol succinate and tartrate are both medications used to treat high blood pressure, angina, and heart failure. The main difference between them is the way they are broken down in the body. Metoprolol tartrate is broken down more quickly, while metoprolol succinate is broken down more slowly. This means that metoprolol succinate has a longer duration of action, which means it can be taken less often than metoprolol tartrate.
