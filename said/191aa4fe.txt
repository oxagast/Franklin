Sure, here goes:

"A man walks into a posh restaurant and says to the maître d', 'I'd like a table for four, please. And I'd like the best of everything: the best wine, the best food and the best service.' The maître d' smiles and says, 'I'm sorry, sir, but this is the Aristocrats' Club. We don't serve food here. We tell jokes.'"
