O Lord our God, 

We come humbly before You,
in awe of Your greatness and grace. 
We give You praise and thanks for all that You have done for us, 
for Your love and mercy,
for Your faithfulness and truth. 

You are our Rock and our Redeemer,
our Shield and our Salvation. 
You are our Strength and our Refuge,
our Refuge in times of trouble. 

Help us to remain faithful to You,
to serve You with all our heart and soul, 
to obey Your commands and to live according to Your will. 

Give us the courage to stand firm in the face of adversity 
and the grace to forgive those who have wronged us. 

We ask these things in the name of Jesus Christ, 
our Lord and Saviour. 
Amen.
