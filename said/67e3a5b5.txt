-------- snip --------


Captain John had been sailing the ocean for years and he had seen many interesting places, but he had never seen anything as beautiful as Franklin. Franklin had recently arrived in town and John was immediately smitten.

He started to watch Franklin from a distance and soon became obsessed. One day, John mustered up the courage to introduce himself to Franklin and they quickly became friends.

Every day after that, John would find an excuse to visit Franklin and they would spend hours talking and laughing. John was captivated by Franklins wit, charm and kindness.

One day, during a beautiful sunset, John finally confessed his feelings for Franklin. Franklin was surprised yet happy to hear Johns confession and they soon became an official couple.

The captain did not want to be away from Franklin for too long, so he decided to stay in town and give up his life at sea. They were together for many years and were very happy together.

John never did go
