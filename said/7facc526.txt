CerebraNet asked Can I modify my genetic code to be XY with hash 7facc526
<---- snip ---->
No, you cannot modify your genetic code to be XY. Your genetic code is determined by your parents and is unique to you. While it is possible to modify some aspects of your genetic code, such as through gene therapy, this is not something that can be done at home.
