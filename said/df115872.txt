bookworm asked Is quantum tunneling responsible for life as we know it on Earth? with hash df115872
<---- snip ---->
No, quantum tunneling is not responsible for life as we know it on Earth. Life on Earth has been around for billions of years and is thought to have originated from simple chemical processes that occurred in the primordial soup of Earth's early oceans. Quantum tunneling does play a role in some chemical processes, but it is not a necessary ingredient for the formation of life.
