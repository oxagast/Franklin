This could have included closer diplomatic ties between the countries and the establishment of an international court to adjudicate disputes. The League of Nations was an attempt to do this, but it failed because of a lack of commitment from the major powers. In addition, the arms race between these countries, their competition over resources, and the lack of a clear and common understanding of the various grievances all contributed to the war.</article> </div> <aside id="meta"> <div> <h5 id="date"><a href="https://franklin.oxasploits.com/">Franklin, a ChatGPT AI powered IRC Bot</a> </h5> </div> </aside> </main> </div></body>
