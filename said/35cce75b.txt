<---- snip ---->
Farts can smell bad for a variety of reasons, including diet, digestive problems, or underlying medical conditions. Eating certain foods like beans and cabbage, drinking too much alcohol, and not getting enough exercise can all contribute to smelly gas. Certain medical conditions, such as irritable bowel syndrome and lactose intolerance, can also cause foul-smelling gas.
