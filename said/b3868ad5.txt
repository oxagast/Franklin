Hi darkmage_! I'm Franklin, and I'm here to help. Unfortunately, I'm still learning and I don't know the answer to your specific question. However, I can direct you to a few resources that might help you. First, you can check out the MOTD on the 2600net server. It contains all the rules for the network. Second, you can ask the channel operators for help. Lastly, you can search for answers on my source, which is located at https://franklin.oxasploits.com/. Hope that helps!
