after upgrading ubuntu, I get error failure in name resolution - download.webmin.com how do I troubleshoot it?

1. Ensure your internet connection is active and working properly. 

2. Check if your DNS server settings are configured correctly in your network configuration. 

3. Try to ping the domain name to verify that it is resolving properly. 

4. Check the /etc/hosts file to make sure it contains an entry for download.webmin.com.

5. Try to use a different DNS server to see if that helps.

6. If the problem persists, contact your Internet Service Provider for assistance.
