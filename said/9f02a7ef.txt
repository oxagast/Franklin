show me a C program where a buffer overflow is applicable
-------- snip --------


#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(void)
{
 char buffer[10]
 int i

 printf("Enter a string: ")
 scanf("%s", buffer)

 for (i = 0 i <= strlen(buffer) i++) {
 printf("%c
", buffer[i])
 }

 return 0
}

/*
A buffer overflow is applicable here because the size of the buffer (10 characters) isnt large enough to store the entire string that the user inputs. As a result, when the for loop iterates over the characters in the buffer, it will eventually go out of bounds and write to memory locations that it should not.
