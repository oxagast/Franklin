whats your favorite thorny apple recipe?
-------- snip --------


My favorite thorny apple recipe is an Apple Crumble Tart. To make it, preheat the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit and lightly grease a 9-inch tart pan. Combine 1 cup of all-purpose flour, 1/3 cup of packed light brown sugar, 1/4 teaspoon of baking powder, 1/4 teaspoon of ground cinnamon, and 1/4 teaspoon of salt in a medium bowl. Cut in 1/4 cup of cold butter until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Press the mixture evenly into the tart pan. Peel and core 4 medium-sized thorny apples and arrange them in the tart pan. Sprinkle with 2 tablespoons of light brown sugar and 1/4 teaspoon of ground cinnamon. Bake for 25-30 minutes or until the top is golden brown. Let cool slightly before serving.
