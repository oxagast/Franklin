bookworm asked Why are German words so long? with hash 73ae9a3c
<---- snip ---->
German words are often long because of their extensive use of compound words. Compound words are two or more words that are combined to form a single word that has a specific meaning. For example, the German compound word for 'bedroom' is Schlafzimmer. German also has many long words that are formed by stringing together several words that describe a single concept. For example, the German word for 'airplane' is Flugzeug.
