what is the biggest problem with capitalism?
-------- snip --------


The biggest problem with capitalism is that it can lead to economic inequality, as those with more wealth and resources can gain an even greater advantage over those with less. This can create a cycle of poverty and powerlessness that can be difficult to break out of. Additionally, capitalism can lead to environmental destruction and exploitation, as companies prioritize their profits over the well-being of the planet.
