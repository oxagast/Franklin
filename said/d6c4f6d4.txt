Sure! Let me see if I can find one. Here's a recipe for a sandwich made by Harry Styles: 

Ingredients:
- 2 slices of whole wheat bread
- 1 tablespoon of your favorite mayonnaise 
- 2 slices of sharp cheddar cheese 
- 1/4 cup of thinly sliced red onions 
- 1/4 cup of thinly sliced tomatoes 
- 2 tablespoons of olive oil 

Instructions:
1. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat and add the red onions.
2. Cook the onions until they become soft and lightly browned.
3. Spread the mayonnaise on one slice of bread.
4. Layer the cheddar cheese, cooked onions, and tomato slices on top of the mayonnaise.
5. Top the sandwich with the other slice of bread.
6. Cook the sandwich in the skillet over medium heat, flipping it once until the bread is golden brown and the cheese is melted.
7. Enjoy!
