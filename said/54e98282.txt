Write a letter of apology for ejaculating on a public sidewalk. Thespian style.
-------- snip --------


My dearest city,

I come to you this day, humbled and ashamed of the gross transgression that I have committed. I stand before you an abject example of the depths to which someone can sink in a moment of poor judgement. I cannot express how deeply sorry I am for my grievous act of ejaculating on your public sidewalk. 

To think that I have caused you, my beloved city, such a level of disgrace and contempt is a truth that I cannot bear. I have shamed myself, my family and all of those who have been dragged into my mess. My heart is heavy with sorrow and regret and I can do nothing but offer my sincerest apology.

I wish I could take back what I have done and undo the damage that I have caused, but I cannot. All I can do is offer my assurance that this will never happen again. I will strive to be a better citizen and act in ways that reflect the highest
