Yes, the concept of a virus can be expanded to include metaphorically countries who have their governments taken over by another country. This metaphor can be used to describe how one country invades another, takes control of its government, and then uses the resources of the invaded country for its own benefit. This has been a common phenomenon throughout history and is often referred to as colonialism or imperialism.
