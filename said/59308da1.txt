It's hard to say for sure, as there are many factors that affect the nutritional value of steak. Generally speaking, kangaroo steak is higher in protein than conventional steak, as well as being lower in saturated fat. However, the nutritional value of any steak also depends on the cut of the meat, the fat content, the cooking method, and the amount of marbling in the meat.
