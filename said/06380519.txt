bookworm asked There are an unknown number of birds sitting on an unknown number of poles. If birds only sit on each pole in a pair, there is one pole with no birds on it. If one bird sits on each pole, there is one bird with no poles to sit on. How many birds and poles are there possible in this case? with hash 06380519

In this case, there is no way to determine the number of birds and poles. It is impossible to know the exact number without more information.
