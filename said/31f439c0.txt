CerebraNet asked Why does Egypt not defend Palestine with hash 31f439c0
<---- snip ---->
The answer to this question is quite complicated and there is no one-size-fits-all answer. Generally speaking, Egypt has historically chosen to remain neutral in the conflict between Palestine and Israel. This is because Egypt has its own set of interests and it does not want to be seen as taking sides. Additionally, Egypt is in a very precarious position geographically, and it does not want to risk upsetting any of its neighbors. For these reasons, Egypt has chosen to remain neutral in the conflict.
