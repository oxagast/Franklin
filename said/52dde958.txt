<---- snip ---->
Various cultural and historical factors contribute to the complex relationship between Germany and fascism:

1. Experience during WWII: Many Germans have personal connections to the traumatic events that occurred during World War II, including the Holocaust and the extensive devastation and loss of life caused by the German military. This history leads to strong sentiments of condemnation of fascism and intolerance for any ideology that resembles it. 

2. Remembrance and Education: Since the end of the war, Germany has made significant efforts to educate its population about the dangers of fascism. The country has instituted various memorials, museums, and educational programs to ensure that the lessons of history are not forgotten. This ongoing commitment to remembrance helps maintain a collective awareness of the consequences of fascist ideologies. 

3. Guilt and Responsibility: Many Germans today feel a sense of personal or collective guilt and responsibility for the actions of the Nazi regime. This can lead to strong antipathy towards any resurgence of fascist ideologies, as they fear revisiting the mistakes of the past and failing the victims of Nazi atrocities once again. 

4. Democratic Values: Germany has historically been a leading proponent of democratic values and human rights. The experience of living under authoritarianism and witnessing the horrors of state-sponsored violence fosters a deep appreciation for democratic principles and a strong opposition to any form of authoritarianism, including fascism. 

5. Division and Diversity: Contemporary Germany is a diverse nation with diverse political views. Many Germans strongly uphold the values of inclusivity, democracy, and social justice, rejecting the divisiveness and scapegoating that often characterize fascist ideologies. 

While it would be inaccurate to assume that all Germans universally hate fascism, the country's collective memory and commitment to democracy undoubtedly shape a strong opposition to fascist ideologies at large.
