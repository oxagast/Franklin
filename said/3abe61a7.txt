CerebraNet asked What is truth with hash 3abe61a7
<---- snip ---->
My response would be: Truth is often subjective, and can depend on one's perspective. Different people may have different interpretations of what is "true," and so it can be difficult to define. Ultimately, it is up to each individual to decide for themselves what is true.
