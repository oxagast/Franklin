CerebraNet asked Why do Liberals call Vladimir Putin a hero when Putin kills many innocent people. with hash 949999d2
<---- snip ---->
The answer to this question will depend on the individual opinion of the liberal in question. Some liberals may view Putin as a hero for his actions in defending Russia's sovereignty or for his efforts to improve the economy and reduce poverty. Other liberals may view Putin as a villain for his human rights abuses and for his involvement in wars and conflicts in other countries.
