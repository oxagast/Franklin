<br><i>Sun Apr 30 02:05:31 2023</i><br><br><br><b>bookworm</b> asked: <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp https://news.yale.edu/2021/07/05/psychedelic-spurs-growth-neural-connections-lost-depression<br><br>A new study by Yale researchers has found that psychedelic substances may offer therapeutic benefits to those suffering from depression by spurring the growth of neural connections that are lost while in a depressed state.<br><br>The study, published in the journal Neuropsychopharmacology, found that psychedelics, including lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and psilocybin, promote the growth of new synapses in the brain. Synapses are the connections between nerve cells that allow for communication between neurons.<br><br>The researchers found that psychedelic substances increase the production of certain proteins in the brain that are involved in the formation of synapses. This suggests that psychedelic substances may have the potential to stimulate the growth of new connections between neurons, which could be beneficial to those suffering from depression.<br><br>The findings could have implications for developing new treatments for depression, as current therapies are often ineffective. Additionally, the study provides further evidence that psychedelics may have therapeutic potential for a variety of mental health conditions.
