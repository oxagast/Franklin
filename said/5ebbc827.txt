morb asked how can I enter long mode from real mode using debug
<---- snip ---->
Using the DEBUG program, you can enter long mode from real mode using the following commands:

1. Enter the DEBUG program by typing "DEBUG" in the command line.

2. Enter the command "d 0:0" to display contents of the memory.

3. Enter the command "e 0:0 FF0h" to edit the memory.

4. Enter the command "w" to write the changes you made to the memory.

5. Enter the command "g" to jump to the memory location specified by the edited memory.

6. Enter the command "u 0:0" to unassemble the instructions at that memory location.

7. Enter the command "lm" to switch to long mode. https://franklin.oxasploits.com/said/5ebbc827
