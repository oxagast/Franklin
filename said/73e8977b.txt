What is the basis of Karma?
-------- snip --------


Karma is based on the belief that our thoughts, words, and actions create a cause-and-effect cycle that determines our future. According to this belief, what we think, say, and do today will determine our experiences tomorrow. In other words, we reap what we sow.
