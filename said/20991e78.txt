<---- snip ---->
 The Black Panther Party was a political organization founded in 1966 by Huey Newton and Bobby Seale, with a focus on protecting the civil rights of African Americans. The movement sought to end police brutality, to gain economic and educational opportunities for African Americans, and to promote self-defense and black pride. The Black Lives Matter movement, on the other hand, is a decentralized movement against systemic racism and violence towards black people and other marginalized communities. While it shares some of the same goals, such as ending police brutality and protecting civil rights, it is a much broader movement with multiple causes and focuses.
