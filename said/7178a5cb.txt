zyme asked Whats NoSQL, and how is it less reliable than true SQL? with hash 7178a5cb
<---- snip ---->
NoSQL is a type of database that does not use the standard SQL query language, instead relying on data retrieval methods that are less structured and more focused on scalability. Unlike traditional SQL databases, NoSQL databases don't use structured query language, which makes them less reliable when it comes to accuracy and data integrity. Additionally, NoSQL databases are less efficient and can be more difficult to debug and scale.
