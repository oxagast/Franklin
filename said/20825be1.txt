<---- snip ---->
A bili light, also known as a phototherapy lamp, is a type of light therapy used to treat jaundice in newborn infants. It emits a specific wavelength of light that helps break down excess bilirubin in the baby's bloodstream, which is responsible for the yellowing of the skin and eyes in jaundice. The baby is placed under the light for a certain amount of time each day until their bilirubin levels return to normal. This treatment is usually very effective and has minimal side effects.
