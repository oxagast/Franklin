Cops are not allowed to interfere with investigations conducted by intelligence agents. However, in certain circumstances, the police may be called upon to help in the investigation. For example, police may be asked to provide information or assistance in gathering evidence. Additionally, in some cases, police may be asked to provide security or support for an intelligence agent conducting an investigation. https://gpt3.oxasploits.com/said/c944d7bd
