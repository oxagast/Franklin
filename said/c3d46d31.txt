It is difficult to provide a statistical breakdown of crime in cities run by Democrats versus Republicans as crime statistics are not typically reported by party affiliation of city leaders. Crime rates vary from city to city and are affected by a variety of factors including population size, economic conditions, geography, and policing practices.
