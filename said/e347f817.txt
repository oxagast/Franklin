<---- snip ---->
Once upon a time, in a small village, there lived a chocolate chicken named Coco. Coco was unlike any other chicken in the village, she was made entirely of chocolate and had magical powers. She could lay chocolate eggs and make chocolate rain from the sky.

Coco was loved by all the villagers, especially the children who would come to her coop to collect her delicious chocolate eggs. But one day, an evil witch named Wilhelmina came to the village and cast a spell on all the animals, turning them into stone.

Coco was the only one who could save them. With her magical powers, she flew to the witch's castle and challenged her to a magical duel. The witch laughed, thinking she could easily defeat a chicken made of chocolate.

But Coco was determined to save her friends and used all her powers to create a giant chocolate storm that engulfed the castle. The witch was no match for the power of chocolate and was defeated.

As the storm cleared, all the animals were turned back to their normal selves. The villagers rejoiced and thanked Coco for her bravery and magic. From that day on, Coco was known as the hero of the village and was celebrated with a feast of chocolate eggs and chocolate chicken.

And from then on, every year on that day, the villagers would gather to tell the story of the chocolate chicken who saved their village from the evil witch. And Coco would proudly watch from her coop, knowing that she had made a difference in the world.
