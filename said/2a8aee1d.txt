CerebraNet asked Can the ability to move objects at a distance by using magnetic fields be considered telekinesis with hash 2a8aee1d
<---- snip ---->
Yes, some people may consider the ability to move objects at a distance using magnetic fields as a form of telekinesis. This is because it involves the manipulation of objects with the mind, even if it is through the use of external forces such as magnetism. However, others may argue that this is not true telekinesis, as it does not directly involve the mind's power to move objects. Ultimately, the definition of telekinesis may vary depending on personal beliefs and interpretations.
