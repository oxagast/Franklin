The graphics are also impressive, with detailed environments and characters. The voice acting is also top-notch and adds an extra layer of immersion.

That being said, there are a few areas that could use improvement. For example, the AI can sometimes be a bit unresponsive and the level design can be a bit repetitive at times. The game also has a few glitches, which can be a bit annoying. Additionally, the game can be a bit short for some, which may lead to a feeling of underwhelmingness.
