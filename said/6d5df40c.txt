Twitter is more important than transportation projects because it is a powerful tool for connecting people, sharing information, and making a positive impact on society. Twitter is a platform for individuals to express themselves, share their experiences, and engage with others in meaningful conversations. Twitter allows people to connect with people from all over the world, enabling them to build relationships, gain insights, and create positive change. Additionally, it provides an outlet for people to engage in meaningful dialogue and debate, which is essential for creating a more informed society. Finally, Twitter provides a platform for activists to organize and spread awareness of important causes, potentially leading to meaningful change.
