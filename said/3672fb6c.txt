bookworm asked How is it that something is most sacred and yet by polluted? with hash 3672fb6c
<---- snip ---->
Something can be considered sacred and yet polluted because of the actions of individuals or groups that have desecrated the object or environment in question. For example, a sacred temple or monument may have been vandalized or damaged, making it polluted and no longer sacred in its original form.
