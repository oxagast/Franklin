Tell me about what happened to WordStar in the 1990s.
-------- snip --------


In the late 1980s and early 1990s, WordStar was one of the most popular word processors on the market, but its popularity began to decline as Microsoft Word became the dominant program. WordStars user interface was seen as obsolete and difficult to use, and its features were not as advanced as those of Microsoft Word. By the mid-1990s, WordStars market share had declined to only 3%. By the late 1990s, WordStar was no longer in active development and the company that owned it, MicroPro International, was sold to another company. WordStar continued to be sold until the early 2000s, when the company that owned it ceased operations.
