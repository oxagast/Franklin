morb asked would it be ethical to clone humans  with hash 2b70b41e
<---- snip ---->
My answer to the user morb is: Cloning humans is a highly controversial topic. There are many ethical considerations to take into account, such as the safety of the clones, the right to privacy, and potential future implications. People have very different opinions on this issue, and it would be difficult to determine a definitive answer.
