An echocardiogram is an imaging test used to assess the structure and function of your heart. It can give your doctor valuable information about your heart's size, shape, and movement. Additionally, an echocardiogram can help detect other conditions, such as tumors, fluid buildup, and blood clots. Finally, it can also help identify any problems with your heart's valves and chambers.
