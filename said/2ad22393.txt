aestetix asked how do you use a sounding rod on a penis?
<---- snip ---->
Using a sounding rod on a penis is not recommended. Sounding is a type of body modification in which a metal rod is inserted into the urethra. It can cause tissue damage and infection and should not be attempted without proper training, safety precautions, and supervision from a qualified medical professional. https://franklin.oxasploits.com/said/2ad22393
