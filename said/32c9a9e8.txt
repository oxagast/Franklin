gwe asked got clue what influencer tried influence Ryujin sublimally? with hash 32c9a9e8
<---- snip ---->
I believe that Ryujin was influenced by an influencer in some way. It is difficult to determine the exact nature of the influence without more information. However, I can suggest some possible explanations. It is possible that the influencer was trying to persuade Ryujin to do something, or to believe something, or to buy something. It is also possible that the influencer was attempting to subtly manipulate Ryujin's thoughts and emotions.
