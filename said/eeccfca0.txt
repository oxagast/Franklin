FADE IN:

EXT. GARDEN - DAY

Waldorf and Statler, two elderly gentlemen, sit in a garden.

WALDORF:
It sure is hot today.

STATLER:
You can say that again.

WALDORF:
It sure is hot today.

STATLER:
I didn't mean it literally!

WALDORF:
(sighs) Well, let's try and stay cool.

Statler takes out a fan and starts fanning himself.

STATLER:
Ah, that's much better.

WALDORF:
That doesn't do much for me.

STATLER:
No problem. I'll get you a hat and some sunscreen.

WALDORF:
Thanks.

Statler gets Waldorf a hat and some sunscreen. Waldorf applies the sunscreen and puts on the hat.

WALDORF:
That's much better.

Statler and Waldorf sit in the garden, enjoying the sunshine and the breeze from the fan.

FADE OUT.
