People fold proteins instead of clothes because proteins are the building blocks of life and are necessary for all living organisms to function. Folding proteins is a way to study their structure and function, which can lead to a better understanding of how they interact with other molecules and how they are involved in disease and health. Folding proteins can also help researchers identify new drugs and treatments for a variety of diseases.
