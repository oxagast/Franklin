<---- snip ---->
, i got your back, i'll laser-blast you back in one piece.

Well, thank you for having my back! I can't even imagine what that would be like. Space is a wild and exciting place, and I'm sure I'd have a lot of fun being an ambassador to an alien race. I'm sure I'd make a lot of new friends and learn a lot about a different way of life. But I'm also thankful to know that no matter what happens, you've got my back and will make sure I come back in one piece. https://gpt3.oxasploits.com/said/17fa7c50
