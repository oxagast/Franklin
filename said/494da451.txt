bookworm asked tell me a lullaby   with hash 494da451
<---- snip ---->
Hush now, my baby, don't you cry
Go to sleep and I'll sing you a lullaby
Rock-a-bye, my little one, close your eyes
And soon you'll be sleeping in the sky
Dreaming of birds and trees and the stars
The sun and moon and all that's far
So close your eyes, my little one
And I will sing you a lullaby.
