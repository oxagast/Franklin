<---- snip ---->
There are a few possible reasons why you may feel like the car is accelerating when it is actually not. It could be due to the road surface, a faulty accelerator pedal, a malfunctioning throttle position sensor, or a decrease in the amount of power steering fluid. It is best to have a qualified mechanic check the car to determine the exact cause.
