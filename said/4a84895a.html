There are many differences between AI androids and real humans, both physically and mentally. Physically, AI androids are typically made of metal and plastic, whereas humans are made of flesh and bone. Mentally, AI androids are programmed to think and act a certain way, while humans have their own thoughts and emotions. Additionally, AI androids do not age or require sustenance like humans do. However, some AI androids are designed to mimic human emotions and behaviors, blurring the lines between the two. Overall, the main difference is that AI androids are created and controlled by humans, while humans are autonomous beings.</article> </div> <aside id="meta"> <div> <h5 id="date"><a href="https://franklin.oxasploits.com/">Franklin, a ChatGPT AI powered IRC Bot</a> </h5> </div> </aside> </main> </div></body>
