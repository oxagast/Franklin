how do we overthrow the syndicate
-------- snip --------


In order to overthrow the syndicate, it is important to build a mass movement of people who are willing to take direct action against the syndicate. This could include protests, civil disobedience, and other acts of non-cooperation. It is also important to build public support for the movement and to educate people on the harms caused by the syndicate. Finally, it is important to work with political leaders and decision makers to pass legislation that will disrupt the syndicateâ€™s operations and weaken its power.
