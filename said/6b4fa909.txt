whats a good way to get zoomers into IRC?
-------- snip --------


One way to get Zoomers into IRC is by creating an IRC channel specifically for Zoomers and encouraging them to join. You can also post about the channel on various social media platforms and online forums, or even create a video tutorial introducing them to the basics of using IRC. Another way is to host events in the chatroom, such as games, quizzes or competitions, which can be a fun way to draw attention to the chatroom. Finally, you can also reach out to specific Zoomers you know, and encourage them to join the chatroom.
