<---- snip ---->
No, I don't think that is fair. Eli Vance was an important and beloved character in the Half-Life universe and his death is a huge loss for the series and its fans. His death was also a significant blow to the game's story and a reminder of the dangers that the characters face in the world of Half-Life.
