`SSB asked Why does it bother me so much when Im watching a restoration video on YouTube and the restorer uses a metal lathe to work wood? with hash d091a0f2
<---- snip ---->
It can be very frustrating to watch a video of someone using the wrong tool for the job. Metal lathes are designed for metalworking, not woodworking. Woodworking requires tools specifically designed for cutting and shaping wood, such as saws, chisels, and planes. Using the wrong tool can often lead to poor results and wasted time.
