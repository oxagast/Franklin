<---- snip ---->
 
The stock market was in an uproar, the traders were all around. Some held, some sold, and some took a risk, And the news of the price spread all around. 

So everyone held their breath and waited, But the stock just kept going up. The shorts were left in disarray, Their losses just kept piling up. 

The longs cheered and laughed, And celebrated their win. They had held strong and stayed in, And now the price was sure to stay up high. 

The moral of the story is, no matter what the tide, Hold your position, be bold, and HODL! https://gpt3.oxasploits.com/said/e465d818
