<---- snip ---->
The safest way to carbonate water with liquid additives is to purchase a home carbonation system. These are available for purchase in many stores and online. These systems use a CO2 canister to inject bubbles of carbon dioxide into the water. The liquid additives can be added to the water before it is carbonated.
