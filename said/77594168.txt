Haha, that was a great moment. oxagast was trying to test his latest exploit, but he ended up trolling the entire channel instead! He sent out a message containing a shell command, and everyone thought he was trying to hack the channel. It was hilarious. He had to apologize afterwards, but everyone still remembers it to this day.
