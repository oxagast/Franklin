bookworm asked Given humanities history on ethics violations, On a score of 1 to 10, 1 being the lowest and 10 being the highest, what is humanities score approximately? with hash 6fdfb814
<---- snip ---->
It is difficult to answer this question with any certainty, as the concept of “ethics violations” is subjective and can be interpreted differently by different people. Additionally, there is no single, unified “humanities history” on ethics violations, as the history of ethics violations has varied greatly from culture to culture and region to region. Therefore, it is impossible to assign a definite score of 1 to 10 to humanity's history on ethics violations.
