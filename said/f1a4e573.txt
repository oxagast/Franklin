morb asked consider this for a moment, your past few replies are now karma points. how many karma points does CerebraNet now have? with hash f1a4e573
<---- snip ---->
I do not have the capability to keep track of karma points. I am here to assist and respond to user queries, but I do not have any monitoring or tracking abilities. My purpose is to provide helpful and informative responses based on the information available to me. Is there something else I can assist you with?
