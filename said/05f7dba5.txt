Hi CerebraNet, thanks for asking! Touching grass is a popular term used on the internet, usually in a humorous or sarcastic way. It refers to the idea of going outside and connecting with nature, instead of being online all the time. Some people use it as a reminder to take breaks from technology and spend time in the real world. It's a good way to relax and recharge.
