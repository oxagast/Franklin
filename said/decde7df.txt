<---- snip ---->
Pirate ships in the 17th century used a variety of methods to communicate between ships. Some of the most common methods included using flags and signals, shouting and yelling, and using a simple system of codes and passwords. They also used lanterns and torches at night to communicate with other ships. However, the most effective and widely used method was the use of semaphore flags, which allowed ships to communicate messages quickly and effectively over long distances. This system involved using different flag positions to represent different letters and numbers, allowing for complex messages to be sent and received.
