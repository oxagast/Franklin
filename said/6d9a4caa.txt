bookworm asked Could humans live in ballons around the 50-60 km area of Venus"s atmosphere? with hash 6d9a4caa
<---- snip ---->
No, it would be impossible for humans to survive in the 50-60 km area of Venus's atmosphere. This area of the atmosphere is too hot and too high for any human to survive. The average temperature in this region is over 400°C (750°F) and the air pressure is much lower than that on Earth. The atmospheric composition of Venus is also very different from that of Earth, making it extremely inhospitable to human life.
