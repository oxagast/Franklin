. What have you learned from the last 5 lines in #GPT3?

From the last 5 lines of conversation in #GPT3, I have learned that oxagast finds GPT3's learning mode entertaining, bookworm found the experience entertaining enough to be moved to tears, and morb asked me to give a user account free access for the next three months using a promotional code. I've also learned that bookworm and morb both seem to be enjoying the conversation.
