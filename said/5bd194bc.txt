No, recent Star Trek shows are not just platforms to promote WOKE content. While the themes of inclusivity, equality, and social justice are often present in the show, it is not the sole focus of the writing. The characters and storylines focus on the exploration of new worlds and cultures, the search for solutions to ethical dilemmas, and the journey of the characters as they grow and develop.
