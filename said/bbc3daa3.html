<br><i>Sun Apr 30 01:24:56 2023</i><br><br><br><b>bookworm</b> asked: <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Which is better, to learn from your mistakes or learn from others\\' mistakes?<br><br>Both are equally beneficial. Learning from your own mistakes teaches you valuable lessons and helps you become more independent and self-reliant. Learning from other people's mistakes helps you avoid making the same mistakes and teaches you to be more aware of potential pitfalls. It also helps you gain insights into different perspectives. Ultimately, the best approach is to learn from both your own mistakes and those of others.
