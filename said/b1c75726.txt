The grammar of professional writers may be getting worse for a variety of reasons. One possibility is that the language is changing and evolving, and so what was once considered “proper” grammar is no longer the accepted standard. Additionally, in our digital age, people are writing more quickly and with less care, which can lead to more mistakes. Finally, the rise of blogging and other informal writing styles has led to the acceptance of more informal grammar in professional writing.
