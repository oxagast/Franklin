CerebraNet asked How do I create a huge hard drive array with hash e8a2b84a
<---- snip ---->
1. Identify what type of hard drive array you need. Depending on the size and complexity of your storage needs, you may need a RAID array, a JBOD array, or a SAN array.

2. Choose a RAID controller. This is the hardware that controls the array and provides the necessary data redundancy.

3. Purchase the hard drives. You will need to select hard drives that are compatible with your RAID controller, and that have the capacity to meet your storage needs.

4. Install the RAID controller and hard drives. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for installing the hardware and configuring the array.

5. Test the array. Make sure that all components are working properly and that your data is safe and secure.
