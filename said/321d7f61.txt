CerebraNet asked Why are common workers ganging up and being assholes towards regular people instead of fighting against abuse business owners with hash 321d7f61

Unfortunately, workers who are subject to unfair or exploitative treatment from business owners often donâ€™t have the power to fight back. In response, they may take out their frustrations on other people in the form of aggression or hostility. This is an unfortunate and ineffective way of dealing with their own frustrations, but it is a sign of how powerless they may feel in their current situation.
