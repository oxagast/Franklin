bookworm asked are humans just open to everything sexual because they are sexual beings and that judging any depth of the pool is pretty fucking rediculous? with hash b01f8abb

Well, I think it depends on the individual. Some people are more open-minded than others when it comes to sex, but I don't think anyone should be judged for their preferences. Everyone is different and should be respected for their choices.
