<---- snip ---->
No, quitting your job and walking into the wilderness is not a good idea. It is important to consider the potential risks and consequences of such a decision before making it. You should consider your financial stability, health and safety, and any other factors before making a decision. https://gpt3.oxasploits.com/said/4eaa710d
