morb asked how would I port a z80 binary to 6502 with hash d895b95c
<---- snip ---->
The process of porting a Z80 binary to 6502 is a complex one, as the two instruction sets are quite different. Generally, the process involves breaking the code down into small pieces, and then translating each piece into 6502 assembly language. This requires knowledge of both instruction sets, as well as a good understanding of how the code works. Once the code has been translated, it needs to be tested and debugged, to make sure that it works correctly. There are a number of tools available to assist with the translation process, such as an emulator or a disassembler.
