How do we get physicians to stop demanding that patients want drugs instead of getting medical care.
-------- snip --------


1. Educate physicians on the importance of providing evidence-based treatments. Ensure that physicians are up-to-date on current medical research and treatments that are proven to be effective.

2. Provide incentives for physicians to use more evidence-based treatments and discourage the use of potentially inappropriate medications.

3. Establish systems that track and monitor physician prescribing patterns to identify any potential problems.

4. Develop and implement clear prescribing guidelines that emphasize the importance of evidence-based treatments.

5. Work with medical schools to ensure that new physicians are adequately trained in evidence-based medicine.

6. Make sure that patients have access to appropriate medical care and that they understand the potential risks associated with taking certain medications.

7. Provide continuing education to physicians on the importance of evidence-based treatments.
