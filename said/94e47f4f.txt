<---- snip ---->
Retardation is not considered a mental illness. It is a general term used to describe people who have an intellectual disability, a condition that can range from mild to severe. People with intellectual disabilities may have difficulties with learning, reasoning, problem-solving, communication, or other skills. Mental illness, on the other hand, is a collective term for a range of psychological illnesses that affect a person's mood, behavior, and thinking.
