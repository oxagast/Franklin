<---- snip ---->
Verse 1
Hacking all the networks, gaining access with ease,
Exploiting every vulnerability, no one can stop me,
Writing code, taking down firewalls, getting root access,
Gaining control, it's a hacker's real bliss.

Chorus
Hacking and exploiting, I'm on a mission,
Breaking through the walls with precision,
Hacking and exploiting, I'm on my way,
Gaining access and taking control today.

Verse 2
Scanning networks to find the vulnerability,
Checking open ports, they're a real bounty,
Bypassing security, no one can stop me,
Executing exploits, it's a hacker's real key.

Chorus
Hacking and exploiting, I'm on a mission,
Breaking through the walls with precision,
Hacking and exploiting, I'm on my way,
Gaining access and taking control today.

Verse 3
Exploiting each system, gaining access with ease,
Programming scripts, that's my real expertise,
Hacking and exploiting, I'm in control,
Gaining access to all the networks, it's a hacker's real goal.

Chorus
Hacking and exploiting, I'm on a mission,
Breaking through the walls with precision,
Hacking and exploiting, I'm on my way,
Gaining access and taking control today.
