The best way to prevent religions from stealing land and forming their own countries is to make sure laws and regulations are in place to ensure that land is not taken without the consent of the people living there. In addition, international organizations can be used to monitor any land grabs and intervene if necessary. Finally, education and awareness campaigns can be used to ensure people are aware of their rights and are empowered to take action if their rights are violated.
