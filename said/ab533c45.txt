Define Scalped in relation to job hiring. 
-------- snip --------


Scalping is a term used to describe a situation in which job applicants with certain desirable characteristics—such as a desirable educational background or experience—are hired at a much higher rate than other applicants who may have similar qualifications. This can create an uneven playing field for job seekers and can lead to discrimination against certain groups of people.
