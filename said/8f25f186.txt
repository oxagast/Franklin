<---- snip ---->
Dolly the Sheep was created in 1996 by scientists at the Roslin Institute in Scotland. She was the first mammal to be cloned from an adult somatic cell, using the process of nuclear transfer. This process involved taking the nucleus from a mammary gland cell of an adult female sheep and transferring it into an egg cell from which the nucleus had been removed. After the egg was stimulated, it began to divide and develop into an embryo, which was implanted into the uterus of a surrogate mother. After around six months of gestation, the surrogate mother gave birth to Dolly.
