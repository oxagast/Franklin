<---- snip ---->
The effects of Toxoplasma gondii in humans can range from asymptomatic to severe. In most cases, the infection is asymptomatic and causes no clinical manifestations, but in some cases, it can cause fever, lymphadenopathy, and other organ-specific manifestations. It can also cause neurological complications, such as encephalitis, and can lead to eye damage if it infects the retina.
