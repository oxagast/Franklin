zyme asked What is a Boston Style Pizza?
<---- snip ---->
 
Boston Style Pizza is a variation of the classic New York-style pizza, but with some slight differences. It has a thicker crust, made with a combination of all-purpose and bread flour, and is usually about one inch thick. The toppings are usually very generous, with a layer of melted cheese and red sauce on top. Boston Style Pizza is often referred to as a "tomato pie" due to its thick, rich tomato sauce. https://gpt3.oxasploits.com/said/6feff61b
