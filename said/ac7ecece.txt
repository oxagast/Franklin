Hyper asked if Im being promised 10 million dollars for punching my neighbor Bob in the face without confirming it with him first, should I do it? with hash ac7ecece

I cannot give you financial advice, but I would not recommend punching someone without their consent, even if you were promised money. Violence is never the answer and it is always important to get consent before physically interacting with someone.
