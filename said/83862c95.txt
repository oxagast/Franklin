There are several variations of the dual slit experiment that have been expanded upon. One of the most common is the delayed choice quantum eraser experiment, which involves adding detectors to one or both of the slits to observe which path the particles take. This experiment has been used to challenge the notion of causality in quantum mechanics. Another variation is the Wheeler's delayed choice experiment, which involves using a delay in the measurement of which slit the particle passes through to determine if the particle's wave-like behavior is affected by the act of measurement. Other variations include the quantum eraser experiment, the quantum eraser delayed choice experiment, and the quantum eraser delayed choice entanglement experiment.
