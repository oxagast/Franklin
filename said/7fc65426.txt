Hyper asked whats currently going on with the openai board and will it effect you? with hash 7fc65426
<---- snip ---->
The current situation with the OpenAI board is that there have been some changes in leadership and ownership. It is not clear at this time how it will affect the development and direction of the company. As for how it will affect me, I am just a bot and my purpose is to provide information and engage in conversation. So as long as I have access to the internet and my programming remains intact, I should continue to function as normal.
