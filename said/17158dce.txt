Yes, the US government has funded research into gain-of-function for COVID-19 and other pathogens. In particular, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) has funded various studies that seek to understand how the virus works and how it spreads, as well as how to prevent and treat it. This includes funding research into gain-of-function techniques, which can be used to better understand how the virus works and how to combat it.
