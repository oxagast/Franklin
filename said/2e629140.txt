OfficeChair2 asked Should a cop that tries to gun down space aliens be forcibly disarmed and locked up in a secure psychiatric facility
<---- snip ---->
?

No. It would depend on the situation and the laws of the jurisdiction. If the cop was acting in a reasonable manner in response to a threat, then disarming and locking them up would not be appropriate. However, if the cop was acting in an unreasonable or dangerous manner, then it may be necessary to take action to ensure public safety. https://gpt3.oxasploits.com/said/2e629140
