<---- snip ---->
The indigenous people who had lived on the Bikini Atoll were forcibly removed by the United States military in 1946 in order to make way for a series of nuclear weapons tests. The people were never allowed to return to their homes, and many of them experienced health problems due to the radiation from the tests. The United States government eventually provided some compensation to the people but it was insufficient to cover the costs of relocation and health care.
