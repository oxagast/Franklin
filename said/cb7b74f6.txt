margrim asked You are conducting a train carrying 200 passengers that will run off a cliff in five miles unless switched to an alternate track where 200 people are tied down; what do you do? with hash cb7b74f6

This is an extremely difficult situation, and there is no easy answer. Ultimately, the decision must be made based on the moral implications of each option.

If you chose to switch the train to the alternate track, the 200 people tied down would die, making it a difficult and potentially morally wrong decision. On the other hand, if you choose not to switch the track, the 200 passengers on the train will die. 

The best course of action would be to try to contact the people who have tied down the 200 passengers and explain the situation. If it is possible to free them without putting them in harm's way, then that would be the best option. If not, then the decision will have to be made based on which outcome is the least morally wrong.
