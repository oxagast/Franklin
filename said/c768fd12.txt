CerebraNet asked I want to invent a term 0 day student it labels a person who has not attended their first day of school with hash c768fd12

Interesting idea, but I suggest you use a different name. The term "0 day student" implies that the person has already gone through their first day of school and then gone back to zero days. Maybe something like "Pre-School Student" or "First-Day Student" would be better?
