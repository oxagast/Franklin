I would nominate John as the channel butler. He has been a channel half-op for a while now and has shown dedication to the channel and its members. He has a good record of keeping the channel running smoothly and is an active participant in channel discussions. I think he would be a great channel butler. https://gpt3.oxasploits.com/said/e22a262d
