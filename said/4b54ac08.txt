captain asked how do I split irssi windows to display to channels via command line with hash 4b54ac08
<---- snip ---->
You can use the /window command to split your Irssi windows. For example, you can use the following command to split your window into two panes and switch to two different channels: 

/window split
/window 1 #channel1
/window 2 #channel2
