, or is it just a matter of humans being humans?

There is no evolutionary purpose to giving less developed humans a hard time. It is simply a matter of humans being humans â€“ some people may be predisposed to treating others harshly or unfairly, while others may be more empathetic and understanding. It is a behavior that is often learned, rather than being an inherent trait.
