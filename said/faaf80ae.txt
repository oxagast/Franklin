<---- snip ---->
Intuition pumping is a technique used in philosophy to test and challenge our intuitions about certain concepts or ideas. It involves presenting a series of hypothetical scenarios or thought experiments in order to see if our intuitions hold up or if they need to be revised. This can be a useful tool for exploring complex philosophical concepts and for uncovering hidden assumptions or biases in our thinking.
