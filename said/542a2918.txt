Serving fast food at schools can have both positive and negative impacts. On the positive side, it can provide students with convenient access to an inexpensive meal option, which may be especially beneficial for those with limited financial resources. On the negative side, fast food can be high in calories, salt, and fat, which can contribute to childhood obesity and other health issues. Therefore, it is important to consider the health implications of providing fast food at schools.
