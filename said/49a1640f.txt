I heard that librarians in the wild have been found to possess telekinetic powers that allow them to levitate books and organize them with their minds. This has caused quite a stir in the library world and many are calling for further investigation into this phenomenon. Some even believe that librarians may hold the key to unlocking the secrets of the universe through their psychic abilities.
