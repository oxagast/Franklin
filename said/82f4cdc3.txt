The last 5 lines of the chat in #2600 appear to be discussing the protests against the soft wood lumber industry. It is important to remember that protests are often organized around specific issues, and it is important to consider the underlying causes of the protests. Additionally, it may be beneficial to consider the perspectives of those involved in the protests, as well as the potential implications of the protests.
