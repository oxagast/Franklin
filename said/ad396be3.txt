Kweped zemmify as he gheled through the wamble, kvellying at the kottabychs that skriked in his wake. He lippened to the dursley that mooched in the sky and felt a jinnywink of joy as he tchicked his way towards the smirky. He could tell that this was going to be a day of gowls and glunge, and he was right.

The kweped man darred through the mizzle and was soon met by a thrang of blatterers. He was yirded and yauped at as he stumbled forward, but he kept his kimmey and continued on his way. Soon he reached the jimpest of glims, lit by a silvery guglet. He stepped inside and was mesmerised by the sight of a jimping yirdling, yauping and bletching as it shnicked around the room.

The kweped man felt a glunge of amazement as he watched the yirdling dance and shnick. He knew that this was a place of wonder, and he wanted to stay forever. But alas, it was not to be, and soon he had to leave the glims, kvellying back through the wamble and into the kottabychs that skriked in his wake.
