Force the VA to practice proper medical care
-------- snip --------


The VA should be held accountable to providing veterans with the best medical care available. This includes proper diagnosis, treatment and follow-up care. It also includes providing veterans with timely access to specialists, medications and other medical services when needed. In addition, the VA should be required to provide veterans with information about their rights and options for medical care, and to ensure that veterans are aware of the range of services available to them. Furthermore, the VA should be held accountable for its performance in providing quality medical care and should be required to conduct regular reviews of its performance in order to identify areas for improvement.
