<---- snip ---->
Imaginary people act in different ways depending on the individual, but some common traits are that they are often creative and resourceful, have distinct personalities and quirks, and can be very imaginative and inventive. They may take on roles or tasks that you assign them, or they can surprise you with their unique solutions to problems. Imaginary people may also behave in ways that reflect your own thoughts, feelings, and beliefs.
