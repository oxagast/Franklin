Ryujin asked what did i miss in #2600 last few  hours with hash 7bbd7895
<---- snip ---->
It seems like there was a discussion about broadband and fiber internet service. Some users were expressing their preference for fiber, while others were discussing their current internet situation. There was also a user who greeted everyone and a user who asked Franklin for an update on the recent activity in the channel. Overall, it seems like there wasn't any major discussion or events that happened in the last few hours.
