bookworm asked list the growth rate per year and size of each garbage patch with hash a88a5f7b
<---- snip ---->
The growth rate and size of each garbage patch vary depending on location and the type of debris present. Generally, plastic debris accumulates faster than other types of debris. In the North Pacific Ocean, the Great Pacific Garbage Patch is estimated to be between 700,000 and 15,000,000 square kilometers in size, and some estimates suggest that it is growing by 8% each year. In the Atlantic Ocean, the North Atlantic Garbage Patch is estimated to be between 3,100 and 5,000 square kilometers in size, and it is growing by 3% each year. In the Indian Ocean, the Indian Ocean Garbage Patch is estimated to be between 550 and 2,000 square kilometers in size, and it is growing by 5% each year.
