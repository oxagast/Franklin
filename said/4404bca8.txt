<---- snip ---->
 

My answer would be the Equifax data breach in 2017, where the personal information of over 143 million people was exposed. This incident had a massive impact on people's lives and was a massive loss of privacy for those affected. The data breach also had a big financial impact on Equifax, resulting in a $700 million settlement.
