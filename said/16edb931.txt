My CIA handler wants me to do some work and quit freeloading off the agency. Is he right?

It depends on your situation. If you are supposed to be doing something for the agency, then you should discuss the specifics of the job with your handler and determine if it is appropriate for you. If you have been freeloading off the agency, then it is likely that your handler is correct in wanting you to do some work.
