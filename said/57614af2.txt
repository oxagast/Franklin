bookworm asked If we deduce that there does not have to be an even number of birds to poles, given that birds only sit in pairs or singly if a pair of birds sits on a pole and one pole is left over and when a single bird sits on the poles 1 is left flying.  What is the minimum number of birds and poles to satisfy the postulate?? with hash 57614af2
<---- snip ---->
The minimum number of birds and poles to satisfy the postulate would be 3 birds and 4 poles. Two birds would sit on one pole, one bird would sit on another pole, and the remaining pole would be left over.
