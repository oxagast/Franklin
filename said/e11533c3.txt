Self-immolation is the act of setting oneself on fire as a form of protest or to draw attention to an issue. It is a form of extreme protest, usually in response to oppressive conditions or to draw attention to a cause. It is a very dangerous and often fatal act, and has been used by many people throughout history, including Buddhist monks in Vietnam, and Indian protesters against the caste system.
