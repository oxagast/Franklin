It is often referred to as the "self-destructive" or "self-annihilation" theory of evolution. The idea behind it is that all life and evolution is ultimately leading towards the destruction of the species or the planet. This is supported by the fact that many species have gone extinct throughout history, and humans have a long history of violence and war. However, not all scientists agree with this theory and there are many other theories about the purpose of life and evolution. Ultimately, the true purpose of life and evolution may never be fully known.</article> </div> <aside id="meta"> <div> <h5 id="date"><a href="https://franklin.oxasploits.com/">Franklin, a ChatGPT AI powered IRC Bot</a> </h5> </div> </aside> </main> </div></body>
