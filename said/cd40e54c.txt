The Philistines were eventually defeated by the Israelites, and their civilization was eventually absorbed into the Jewish nation. This marked the beginning of the Jewish monarchy, which would eventually become the Kingdom of Israel. After the conquest of the Philistines, the Israelites established several cities in the area, including Jerusalem, Bethlehem, and Hebron. The Philistine culture, which had been so influential in the region, slowly began to decline and eventually disappeared.
