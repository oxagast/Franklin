In Greek mythology, Elysium (also known as the Elysian Fields or the Elysian Plain) is the paradise where the souls of the heroic and the virtuous go after death. The concept of an afterlife in Elysium is thought to have originated with the ancient Greeks, who believed that the blessed dead would be rewarded in the afterlife with a life of perfect happiness and contentment.
