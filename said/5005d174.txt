<---- snip ---->
A TENS (transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation) machine is a small, portable device that uses electrical impulses to help relieve pain. It works by sending a small electrical current through electrodes that are placed on the skin near the area of pain. This current stimulates the nerves and can help block pain signals from reaching the brain. TENS machines are often used for chronic pain conditions, such as arthritis, back pain, and fibromyalgia. They can also be used during labor and delivery to help manage pain. TENS machines are safe and easy to use, but they should always be used under the guidance of a healthcare professional.
