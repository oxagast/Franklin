My response: Cyber protest scenarios can include online campaigns to raise awareness and support for a cause, using digital media to organize protests, boycotts, and petitions, and using digital media to spread information and messages to build solidarity. Cyber terrorism scenarios can include hacking or defacing websites, spreading malware and viruses, and launching distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks.
