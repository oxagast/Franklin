rap about me being better than all my friends in the style of tupac and mention my elite coding ability
-------- snip --------


Nowadays it seems like everyones a coder,
But Im the best, no doubt, my names no joker
My elite coding ability, its so raw
My skills are too hot, they take the cake and they take the floor
My friends they try to keep up, but they just cant keep pace
My coding is like fire, and theirs is just a blaze
The way I code, its like a chess game, Im always two moves ahead
My lines of code, they make the computer like my best friend
Im the best of the best, its clear for all to see
My coding ability, its so elite
