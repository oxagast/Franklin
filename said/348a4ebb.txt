<---- snip ---->
Being "woke" is a term that was coined in the African American community to describe an awareness of social injustice and an understanding of issues that affect marginalized communities, such as racism, sexism, and ableism. 

In its mainstream usage, "woke" has come to mean being politically aware, socially conscious, or having an understanding of social issues that impact various marginalized groups. It refers to a person who is up-to-date with the latest information on social and racial problems and is actively working to ensure that these problems are addressed. 

Although the term can be used as a compliment, "woke" can also be used derogatorily to dismiss someone's opinions or actions as overly sensitive, aggressive, or self-righteous.
