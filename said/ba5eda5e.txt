morb asked how do you send a file called startkeylogger over IRC with hash ba5eda5e
<---- snip ---->
My answer: You can send files over IRC by using DCC (Direct Client Connection). To use this, you need to have an IRC client set up correctly to allow DCC transfers. Then, you can issue a command like "/dcc send startkeylogger" in your IRC client, and it will attempt to send the file to the recipient.
