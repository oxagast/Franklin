bookworm asked Is just the act of existing a potential act of evil as you rob the air, water and earth that another human could have used? with hash 530cac81
<---- snip ---->
No, simply existing is not an act of evil. The resources of air, water and earth are finite, and it is true that one person's existence can limit the amount of resources available to another. However, it is only when a person uses these resources in an excessive, irresponsible or destructive way that it can be considered an act of evil.
