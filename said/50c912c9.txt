A new type of drug that could slow down the progression of Alzheimer's disease is being tested on humans for the first time.

The drug, called Aducanumab, is designed to target a sticky protein called amyloid-beta that builds up in the brains of people with Alzheimer's, causing damage and leading to a decline in mental ability.

The drug is being tested on 165 people with early-stage Alzheimer's in the UK, Canada and the US.

The drug is injected into the brain and works by targeting and removing the amyloid-beta protein.

If successful, the drug could be the first to slow down the progression of Alzheimer's, rather than just treating the symptoms.

The trial, which is being led by pharmaceutical company Biogen, is expected to last for 18 months.

The results of the trial will be published later this year.
