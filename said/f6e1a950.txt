There is no specific amount of vinegar for a 2 load washing machine rinse cycle to make clothes flea resistant. Vinegar can be added to the rinse cycle to help kill fleas, but the amount will depend on the amount of water used in the rinse cycle. Generally, 1/2 to 1 cup of vinegar should be added per load.
