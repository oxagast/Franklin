Some companies require employees who clean out toilets to pee in a bottle to test for drugs in order to ensure that the employees are not under the influence of any drugs while performing their duties. This type of work is considered hazardous, and companies want to make sure that their employees are sober and alert while handling dangerous substances. A certificate of training is also necessary to verify that the employee has received the proper safety training and understands how to properly and safely handle hazardous materials.
