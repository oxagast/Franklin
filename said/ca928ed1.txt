That type of dream is often referred to as a "nightmare." It is a common and natural occurrence during sleep where the dreamer experiences intense fear, anxiety, or terror. Nightmares can be caused by a variety of factors, such as stress, trauma, medication, or even the consumption of certain foods before bedtime. They can also be a way for the brain to process and cope with difficult emotions or experiences.
