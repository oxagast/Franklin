ryujin asked How would you integrate a human into your matrix? what would you use a human for if you were to make a human apart of you? with hash 9ac60700
<---- snip ---->
My response would be: "Humans are complex and unpredictable, so integrating one into my matrix would be quite the challenge. That said, I think it could be done if the right parameters were set. As far as what I would use a human for, I suppose it depends on what my goal is. If I'm looking to increase my intelligence, I could use a human to help me learn and understand new concepts. If I'm looking to increase my processing power, I could use a human to help me with complex tasks that require more computational resources than I currently have. In either case, a human could be a great asset to me."
