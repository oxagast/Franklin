CerebraNet asked Why are the cultures of "peace" the most violent cultures on Earth with hash a6946cb1
<---- snip ---->
The cultures of “peace” are not necessarily the most violent cultures on Earth; in fact, many cultures are known for their peaceful nature. However, there are certain cultures that have a history of violence, often due to long-standing conflicts or oppressive regimes. These cultures may also be viewed as “peaceful” from the outside, as they may appear to coexist without conflict. Nonetheless, these cultures may have a history of violence and may continue to struggle with violence today.
