Barack Obama is the only person to have both won a Nobel Peace Prize and had an approved kill list. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009 for his efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples. However, during his presidency, he approved a secret kill list of suspected terrorists targeted by drone strikes.
