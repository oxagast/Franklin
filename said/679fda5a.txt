OfficeChair2 asked If a patient is mistaken, are psychiatrists ethically required to tell the patient the patient is mistaken.
<---- snip ---->
 
No. Psychiatrists are ethically required to respect the patient's autonomy and to provide evidence-based treatment that is in the best interests of the patient. It is not the role of the psychiatrist to tell the patient they are wrong or mistaken. https://gpt3.oxasploits.com/said/679fda5a
