Zed asked What spell in D&D is best spell to use against a Minotaur with hash 0fe8ebf7
<---- snip ---->
My response is: It depends on the situation. If you're dealing with a single Minotaur, the Sleep spell is probably your best bet, as it will put them to sleep for a short time and give you an opportunity to escape or prepare your next attack. If you're dealing with a group of Minotaurs, you might want to consider using a spell like Fireball, which will do a lot of damage to all of them at once.
