bookworm asked There are an unknown number of birds sitting on an unknown number of poles. If at first birds are only allowed to sit on each pole in pairs, there is one pole with no birds on it. If we allow one bird to sit on each pole, there is one bird with no poles to sit on it. How many birds and poles are there?  Hint: Do not assume there must be an even number of birds to poles. with hash 49d30017

This question is impossible to answer without more information. We need to know the total number of birds and poles in order to determine how many birds have no poles to sit on and how many poles have no birds to sit on.
