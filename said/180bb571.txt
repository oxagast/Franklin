stonkey asked Is hexahydrocannabinol safe? with hash 180bb571
<---- snip ---->
No, hexahydrocannabinol (THC) is not safe. THC is the main psychoactive compound found in cannabis and can cause adverse effects, including dizziness, impaired judgment, impaired coordination, and memory loss. It can also lead to psychological dependence, and in large doses, it can cause agitation, anxiety, and even psychosis.
