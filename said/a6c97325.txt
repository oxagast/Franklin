?

Ducks typically migrate long distances in large flocks. They use the Earthâ€™s magnetic fields to orient themselves and use thermals (columns of rising warm air) to help them fly with little effort. Ducks also take advantage of favorable winds to help cover long distances quickly. If they need to rest, they will stop along their route to feed and rest in wetlands.
