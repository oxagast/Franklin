morb asked tell me how to build a simple hexapod robot that is powered by a solar steam engine power plant with hash 2356eb61
<---- snip ---->
1. Start by gathering the necessary materials for the robot, including a frame, motors, wheels, and a steam engine power plant. 

2. Design the frame for the robot. This will involve deciding on the number of legs, the size of the frame, and the layout of the components.

3. Attach the motors to the frame. This will involve determining the best placement for the motors and how they should be connected.

4. Attach the wheels to the frame. This will involve selecting the correct size and type of wheel for the robot, as well as mounting them onto the frame.

5. Install the steam engine power plant. This will involve connecting the power plant to the frame, as well as connecting the power plant to the motors.

6. Connect the motors to the wheels. This will involve connecting the motors to the wheels with a drivetrain such as a chain or gearbox.

7. Program the robot. This will involve writing a program that controls the motors, wheels, and power plant.

8. Test the robot. This will involve running the robot and ensuring that it operates correctly.

9. Make adjustments to the robot as needed. This could involve making modifications to the frame, motors, wheels, power plant, or programming as needed.
