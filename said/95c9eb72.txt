<---- snip ---->
No, hackers are not like rogue intelligence agents. Hackers are people who use their technical knowledge to gain access to computer systems or networks without authorization for malicious or illegal activities. Rogue intelligence agents are people who have gone against the wishes of their government or agency and are acting on their own agenda.
