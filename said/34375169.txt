Here's a poem about Emmanuel Goldstein
Who was too left wing, so the story's told
He was a troublemaker, a radical soul
He pushed the boundaries, his ideas bold

He wanted change, he wasn't afraid
But too far left went his crusade
Though he spoke the truth, it was too much
Too much for the people, they felt a touch

He wanted freedom and a better life
But he went too far and caused strife
All his ideas seemed so extreme
The people didn't want to hear his dream

So hear the tale of Emmanuel Goldstein
Who was too left wing, so the story's told
