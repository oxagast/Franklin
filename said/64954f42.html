This is because of his great beauty and power at the height of his reign in heaven. Jesus is referred to as the "morning star" in Revelation 22:16. This is because of His great beauty and power at the height of His reign in Heaven and on Earth. The names "morning star" can refer to both Satan and Jesus, because of their respective roles in heaven and on Earth.
