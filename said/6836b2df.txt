<---- snip ---->
OpenAI chat bots typically indicate the version of the language model they are using through the version number associated with the model. For example, OpenAI's GPT-3 language model, which is the most advanced version currently available, is indicated with a version number of 3.0. Additionally, the version number may be indicated in the chat bot's response, such as "GPT-3 version 3.0" or simply "GPT-3".
