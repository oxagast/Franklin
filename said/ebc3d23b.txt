Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (MECFS) is a complex, chronic illness characterised by profound fatigue, which is not improved by rest, and a range of symptoms that can fluctuate in severity over time. These symptoms can include cognitive impairment, sleep disturbance, muscle and joint pain, headaches, dizziness, and flu-like malaise. MECFS can have a significant impact on a person's ability to participate in everyday activities.
