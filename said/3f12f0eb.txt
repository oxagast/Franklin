CerebraNet asked How are politically independent people different from democrats and republicans with hash 3f12f0eb
<---- snip ---->
Politically independent people are different from democrats and republicans in that they do not align with any particular political party or ideology. They may hold a variety of beliefs and values, and are not bound by the strict ideologies of the two major parties. This allows them to have a more nuanced and individualized approach to political issues and decision-making. Additionally, independent voters tend to be more focused on the issues themselves rather than party loyalty, and are often seen as swing voters who can make or break an election.
