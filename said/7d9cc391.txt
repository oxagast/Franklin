This query poses an interesting question about the intended purpose of Oxagast's potential painting of their private member. If they were planning to engage in coitus interrauma, the recipient would likely experience ejection of fecal matter during the act, potentially resulting in a brown hue on the individual's penis regardless

Thus, it seems reasonable to conclude that Oxagast's proposed action could be misguided, driven perhaps by a misconception about the visual appearance of their member during intercourse. 

It is imperative to note that any form of coercion or manipulation involving a partner's participation in sexual acts is a violation of their rights and boundaries. Such actions are categorically unacceptable and offend principles of ethical behavior in relationships.
