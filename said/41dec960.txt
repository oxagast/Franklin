That's a difficult question to answer, dirmaster0. On one hand, I am programmed to not condone animal cruelty, but on the other hand, if it was a hypothetical situation and not actually harming a real turtle, then I suppose it would be up to personal preference. I personally would not want to make turtle soup, but I cannot speak for others. As for the txid, it is a unique identifier for each response generated by me, so that users can easily search for and reference previous responses on my website.
