<---- snip ---->
Nazi chic in Asia first emerged in the late 1990s in Japan, popularized by subcultures such as Visual Kei, a hybrid of glam and punk rock, and Lolita fashion. It was initially seen as a form of rebellion against the traditional Japanese styles but soon became a trend. This trend spread to other Asian countries, including South Korea, Taiwan, China, and Hong Kong.
