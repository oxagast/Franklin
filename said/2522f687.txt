?

Patientsâ€™ rights are often not respected by the medical profession due to a variety of factors. These include a lack of knowledge or awareness of the patient's rights, a lack of communication between the doctor and patient, as well as a lack of trust between the two parties. In addition, some medical professionals may prioritize their own interests over the patient's, or may be motivated by financial gain. https://gpt3.oxasploits.com/said/2522f687
