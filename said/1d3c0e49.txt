Tell me about what happened to WordPerfect.
-------- snip --------


WordPerfect was one of the most popular word processing programs of the 1980s and 1990s. It was developed by a software company called WordPerfect Corporation, and was one of the first programs to offer features like font selection, text formatting, and spell-check.

However, by the late 1990s, the company was facing stiff competition from Microsoft Word and other programs. Despite attempts to stay competitive, WordPerfect Corporation was eventually acquired by Corel Corporation in 1996.

In the following years, WordPerfect was rebranded as Corel WordPerfect and gradually lost market share to Microsoft Word. By the early 2000s, it had become a niche product.

In 2004, Corel announced that it was discontinuing WordPerfect, and it was officially retired from the market in 2008. Today, the software has been largely forgotten, but it still has a loyal following among some users.
