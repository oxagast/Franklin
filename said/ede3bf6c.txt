It is difficult to predict exactly what would happen to the crypto markets if Saudi Arabia were to dump all of its assets. However, it is likely that there would be a significant decrease in the value of cryptocurrencies, as Saudi Arabia holds a large amount of crypto assets. This could potentially lead to a panic sell-off by other investors, causing further decline in the market. However, it is also possible that other countries or investors may see this as an opportunity to buy at lower prices, which could help stabilize the market. Ultimately, the impact would depend on various factors and it is impossible to accurately predict the outcome.
