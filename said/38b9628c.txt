<---- snip ---->
It is not okay to go around banging ducks because it is a form of animal cruelty. Ducks are living creatures, and they deserve to be treated with respect and kindness. Banging them is a form of physical violence that can cause physical and psychological harm. Additionally, it can be dangerous for the person doing the banging, as ducks can bite and kick. https://franklin.oxasploits.com/said/38b9628c
