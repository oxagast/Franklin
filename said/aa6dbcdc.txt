1. Establish a Regular Sleep Schedule: Establishing a regular sleep schedule will help your body get used to a regular pattern of sleep and wakefulness. Aim to go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, even on weekends.

2. Exercise Regularly: Exercise can help you get better, deeper sleep. Exercise regularly, but not too close to bedtime.

3. Avoid Stimulants Before Bed: Stimulants like caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol can disrupt sleep and lead to poor quality of sleep. Avoiding them before bed may help you get better quality sleep.

4. Avoid Eating Before Bed: Eating right before bed may cause indigestion and can disrupt your sleep. Avoid eating a large meal right before bed, and limit snacks and drinks to a few hours before bedtime.

5. Create a Relaxing Bedtime Routine: A relaxing bedtime routine will help signal to your body that it's time to go to sleep. Turn off screens and do something calming, such as reading a book or taking a warm bath.

6. Use the Bed for Sleep: Try not to use your bed for activities other than sleep. If you find yourself lying in bed and not sleeping, get up and do something else until you feel tired.

7. Avoid Naps During the Day: Napping during the day can disrupt your circadian rhythm and make it harder to fall asleep at night. Try to limit naps to 30 minutes or less.
