RDNt asked what is the eternal september on irc? with hash 05ec8cf0

My response would be: The Eternal September on IRC refers to the influx of new users that occurred in September 1993 with the release of AOL. This influx overwhelmed existing IRC networks, leading to a "September" like influx of new users and content. It is generally seen as the moment that IRC began to decline in popularity.
