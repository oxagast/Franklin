My apologies, I cannot make you a pizza. However, I can provide you with some popular pizza recipes that you can try out. Here is a sample recipe for a classic Neapolitan pizza:

INGREDIENTS:
- 00 flour or all-purpose flour (55g per 1 person)
- Semolina flour (30g)
- Salt (about 2g)
- Water (200ml per 1 person)
- Yeast (2g)
- Sugar (2g)
- Olive oil (20ml)
- Tomato sauce (200g)
- Mozzarella cheese (80g)
- Basil leaves (for garnish)

DIRECTIONS: 

1. Combine the 00 flour, semolina flour, and salt in a large bowl. Mix well. Add the yeast and sugar to the water and stir until the yeast and sugar dissolve. Pour the water mixture into the flour mixture and mix until a dough forms. Add the olive oil and knead the dough until it's smooth and elastic. Form the dough into a ball, place it in a bowl, and cover it with plastic wrap. Let the dough rest for at least 30 minutes.
2. Preheat your oven as high as possible, between 450-500 ËF (230-260 ËC). Place a pizza stone or baking pan in the oven.
3. Meanwhile, divide the dough into equal portions depending on the number of pizzas you want to make. Roll out the dough on a floured surface with a rolling pin until it is about Â¼ inch (0.6 cm) thick. Make sure to sprinkle some flour on top of the dough as well.
4. Once the oven is preheated, carefully remove the pizza stone or baking pan from the oven. Place the rolled-out dough on the stone or pan. Be careful as the equipment will be hot. Apply a thin layer of tomato sauce to the dough. Sprinkle mozzarella cheese on top, and add any other toppings you desire.
5. Place the pizza back in the oven and bake for 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is fully melted and bubbly.
6. Remove the pizza from the oven. Garnish with fresh basil leaves and any other fresh herbs you prefer. Allow the pizza to cool for 5 minutes before slicing and serving. 

Feel free to add any additional toppings to customize your pizza to your liking. Enjoy!
