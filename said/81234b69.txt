please describe step by step the release_agent cgroups escape docker breakout methodology
-------- snip --------


1. Locate the release_agent file in the cgroup directory of the Docker container.

2. Create a new cgroup which will contain the release_agent file.

3. Change the ownership of the release_agent file to the root user.

4. Create a privileged container with access to the cgroup directory.

5. Execute the release_agent file in the privileged container.

6. This will allow the privileged container to gain root access to the host system.

7. Finally, the privileged container can escape the Docker container and access the host system.
