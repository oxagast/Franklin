Why did the Jews rob and kill other tribes 3000 years ago
-------- snip --------


The Jews conquest of Canaan and their subsequent battles with other tribes in the region around 3000 years ago were part of a larger effort to establish a Jewish homeland. At the time, the Jews were a people without a nation and were looking to create a place of their own. In order to do so, they had to gain control of the land, and this often meant fighting other tribes and seizing their resources. In some cases, this meant raiding and killing, as was common in ancient warfare.
