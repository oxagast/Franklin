You should be aware of your surroundings and always trust your gut. If you notice anything out of the ordinary, leave the area immediately. Make sure you have an escape route planned in advance. If you are in a large public area, consider carrying a whistle or some type of alarm. Also, look into self-defense classes or carrying a non-lethal weapon such as pepper spray or a taser.
