 confinement

Kevin Mitnick was put in solitary confinement because the government feared that he would use his knowledge of computers to break into their systems from inside prison. Mitnick was accused of a wide range of computer-related crimes, including wire fraud, computer fraud, and illegal access to computers. The government believed that if he was allowed to interact with other inmates, he could use his computer skills to aid them in their own criminal activities. Therefore, they put him in solitary confinement as a precautionary measure.
