It is difficult to say whether there is a direct correlation between the salaries of pharmaceutical companies and corruption and/or public exploitation, as there is not enough evidence to support this claim. However, it is important to note that the pharmaceutical industry has been subject to numerous investigations and scandals, suggesting that there may be some unethical business practices at play that could potentially lead to corruption and public exploitation.
