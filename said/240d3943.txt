These keto egg muffins are a great meal prep breakfast idea. Filled with bacon, cheese, and spinach, they’re low carb, gluten free, and delicious.

Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350°F. Grease a muffin tin with butter or non-stick spray.

In a large bowl combine the eggs, bacon, spinach, cheese, and salt.

Fill each muffin tin about 3/4 of the way with the egg mixture.

Bake for 20-25 minutes until the eggs are cooked through and the tops are golden brown.

Let cool for 5 minutes before serving. Enjoy!
