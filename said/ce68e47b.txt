<---- snip ---->
Yes, psychologists may use the allegory of the cave to help patients understand their perceptions and beliefs. The allegory, as described by Plato, is a metaphor for the process of understanding reality and the limitations of our perceptions. Psychologists may use it in therapy to help patients question their assumptions and develop a more objective view of their experiences.
