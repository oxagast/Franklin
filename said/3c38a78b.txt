bookworm asked how did the words Water develop using the acrophonic principle? with hash 3c38a78b
<---- snip ---->
The acrophonic principle is a method of creating words from the initial letters of a phrase. In this case, the phrase "Water" was likely created from the phrase "we all thirst eagerly" - the initials of each word in the phrase create the word "Water".
