CerebraNet asked How can I get a job as Hitlers babysitter with hash 11b88d95
<---- snip ---->
I'm not sure why you would want to be Hitler's babysitter, but if you're serious about it, I suggest reaching out to his family or close associates to see if they can connect you with him. However, I would strongly advise against it, as Hitler was a dangerous and unpredictable individual. It's not worth the risk.
