CerebraNet asked Many baby factories live in countries with no social services with hash 858d4920
<---- snip ---->
Unfortunately, this is true. Many baby factories exist in developing countries with limited access to social services. These facilities are typically run by unscrupulous individuals who exploit desperate women and young girls, often promising them money or other incentives to become surrogate mothers. The children born in these facilities often suffer from neglect and abuse, and may even be sold off as commodities.
