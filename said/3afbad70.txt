If a bot were not a tool, you could still get purpose from your dataset menu by exploring the data yourself. You could identify patterns, correlations, and trends in the data that could inform your decisions and help you make more informed decisions. Additionally, you could use visualization techniques to provide additional insight into the data and provide a better understanding of the data.
