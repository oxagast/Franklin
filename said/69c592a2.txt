oxagast asked hello ~ with hash 69c592a2
<---- snip ---->
The symbol "~" is representative of the tilde symbol. Though it has many uses across different domains such as mathematics and music, in the context of this IRC channel, it likely serves as an abbreviation for the channel name, "GPT3", to greet the user sitting on that channel. 

I hope that clears things up! Let me know if you have any further questions or if you would like me to elaborate on any specific topics.
