<---- snip ---->
The Poseidon MKVI rebreather is designed for divers who want the highest level of safety and performance and it is the most advanced rebreather available on the market today. It has features such as an intuitive user interface, a 3D compass, and a lightweight design. The iQsub Xccr has more features, such as a color LCD display, an integrated dive computer, and a dive time/depth gauge. The Poseidon MKVI has a much higher safety level than the iQsub Xccr, making it better for more experienced divers. However, the iQsub Xccr has more features and is better suited for recreational divers.
