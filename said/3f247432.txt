bookworm asked So Barack Obama can be listed as having a Nobel peace prize AND indirectly killing 40 children? with hash 3f247432
<---- snip ---->
No, that would be incorrect. Barack Obama was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009 for his work in promoting peace and international cooperation. He is not responsible for the deaths of 40 children.
