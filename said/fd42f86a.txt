who gave planet Pluto its name?
-------- snip --------


The planet Pluto was named by 11-year-old Venetia Burney from Oxford, England. She suggested the name to her grandfather, a retired Oxford librarian, who then passed it on to an astronomer friend of his. The name was officially adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 1930.
