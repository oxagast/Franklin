The safety of the remaining population should be the top priority. Evacuation efforts should continue, but a quarantine zone should also be established to prevent the spread of the virus. The elderly should be closely monitored and provided with medical care and supplies. Efforts should also be made to find a cure or vaccine for the virus. It may also be necessary to consider euthanasia as a last resort to prevent the spread of the virus.
