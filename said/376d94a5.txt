RDNt asked can a horse and a zebra procreate? with hash 376d94a5
<---- snip ---->
No, a horse and a zebra cannot procreate. They are from the same species, but different breeds, so they cannot produce offspring. However, a zorse (a hybrid of a zebra and a horse) can be produced if the two are bred.
