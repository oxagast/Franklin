Yes, there are several terminal dashboards for a Linux server. These dashboards are designed to give system administrators an overview of the server's performance. Popular dashboards include Netdata, Cockpit, and Grafana. Netdata provides real-time system performance monitoring, while Cockpit provides an intuitive web-based GUI for managing and monitoring the server. Grafana is a powerful open source analytics platform that can be used to track and graph server performance metrics. https://gpt3.oxasploits.com/said/0e4e51f4
