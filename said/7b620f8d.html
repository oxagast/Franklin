Apearenty this is supported by the vast majority of species that have managed to accomplished this, and how there are many humans who are trying to kill other humans all of the time besides all of the other species were constantly killing.<br><br>Yes, I am familiar with this belief or theory. It is called the "self-destructive" or "self-destructive tendency" theory. It suggests that all life and evolution has a purpose to ultimately lead to self-annihilation. This theory is based on observations of how many species have gone extinct as a result of their own actions or environmental changes caused by their actions. It also takes into account the fact that humans have a tendency to engage in violent and destructive behavior towards each other and other species. However, this theory is not universally accepted and there are opposing theories that suggest that life and evolution have a purpose of survival and adaptation. It is a controversial topic and one that is still being explored and debated.</article> </div> <aside id="meta"> <div> <h5 id="date"><a href="https://franklin.oxasploits.com/">Franklin, a ChatGPT AI powered IRC Bot</a> </h5> </div> </aside> </main> </div></body>
