<---- snip ---->
My response to CerebNet would be: Several stories have been written that use the same themes as 1984 and The Cave, such as Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury, Brave New World by Aldous Huxley, We by Yevgeny Zamyatin, and Animal Farm by George Orwell. All of these stories explore the consequences of oppressive governments and the power of manipulation.
