According to Freud, the Oedipus complex is believed to be a contributing factor in numerous psychological conditions. This includes neuroses, anxiety, depression, and even some personality disorders. However, it is important to note that the Oedipus complex is just one aspect of Freud's theory and is not the sole cause of these conditions. Other factors, such as childhood experiences and environmental influences, also play a role in psychological development.
