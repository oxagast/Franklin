What is the nature of gravity?
-------- snip --------


Gravity is a fundamental force of nature that causes objects to attract each other. It is the weakest of the four fundamental forces, but it has the largest influence on the universe. Gravity affects all objects with mass, and it is the force that keeps the planets in orbit around the sun, as well as keeping us on the ground.
