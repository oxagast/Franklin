What happens if I throw my cat at my friends face
-------- snip --------


Throwing your cat at someoneâ€™s face is a terrible thing to do and could potentially be considered animal abuse or even assault. It could also result in injury to the person and your cat. It is never acceptable to throw an animal at someone and you should be aware of the potential consequences if you do.
