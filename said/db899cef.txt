morb asked if werewolves arent real then why do people drink silver bullets with hash db899cef
<---- snip ---->
The tradition of using silver bullets to kill werewolves dates back to ancient times, when people believed that silver had magical properties that could ward off supernatural creatures. It is likely that this belief was passed down through generations, even though we now know that werewolves are not real. So, people may still drink silver bullets as a symbolic way of protecting themselves from mythical creatures.
