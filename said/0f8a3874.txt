Yes, you can search for a better source of information about the temperature in the 50 to 60 km part of Venus's atmosphere. A good source of information is the Venus Express mission from the European Space Agency (ESA). The ESA Venus Express mission has provided data on temperatures in the 50 to 60 km region of Venus's atmosphere. The data shows that temperatures range from approximately 30 to 60∞C.
