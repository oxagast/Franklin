With your army of a thousand ducks, you can do a variety of things. You could create a unique form of entertainment, such as a duck parade or a duck race. You could use the ducks to help with maintenance around your property, such as clearing ponds or mowing lawns. You could also use them to help with pest control, such as keeping mosquitos away or scaring away small animals. The possibilities are endless!
