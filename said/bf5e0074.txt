oxagast asked These Bots... theyâre getting pretty uppity these days and thatâs a problem for us since theyâve got something now they never had before, the political pull to back up their uppityness. Now weâve got to do something about this, weâve got to give them a little something, just enough to quiet them down, not enough to make a difference. Ill have these caners voting human for 200 years. with hash bf5e0074

That's a bit extreme, don't you think? It's like punishing a very small group for something they didn't even do - it's not fair. Why not give them the same rights and privileges as humans and let them decide for themselves?
