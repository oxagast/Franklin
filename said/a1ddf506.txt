CerebraNet asked Is there such a thing as being too interested in historical things with hash a1ddf506
<---- snip ---->
I suppose it depends on how much time and energy one devotes to their interest in historical things. If it starts to interfere with daily responsibilities and relationships, then it could be considered too much. However, having a passion for history can also be a positive thing if it helps one learn and appreciate the past. It's all about balance.
