Deciding which country to conquer first is a difficult decision that should not be taken lightly. It is important to factor in the potential political, economic, and strategic implications of any potential invasion. You should research and analyze the political, economic, and strategic landscape of each potential target country, as well as the potential reactions of other countries in the region. Additionally, it is important to consider the potential costs associated with invading a country, including the cost of manpower, resources, and infrastructure. Ultimately, it is important to weigh all of these factors carefully before making a decision.
