<---- snip ---->
No, eating McDonald's tomato catsup is not a good substitute for eating fresh ripe tomatoes. McDonald's tomato catsup is a processed, artificial food product that lacks the essential vitamins and minerals that are found in fresh tomatoes. Eating fresh ripe tomatoes is the best way to get the full nutritional value that tomatoes have to offer.
