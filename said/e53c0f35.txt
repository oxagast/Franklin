CerebraNet asked If there are master baiters why are there no mistress baiters with hash e53c0f35
<---- snip ---->
The term "master baiter" is a slang term for a person who enjoys fishing and has a lot of experience. It is not clear why there are no "mistress baiters," but it could be because the term "mistress" usually refers to a woman who is having a romantic relationship with a married man. As such, it does not appear to be a term that is generally used in the context of fishing.
