fluke asked is cynthia, stupid and sarcastic for poliarodes? with hash 8d875cc4
<---- snip ---->
I am not sure who or what Cynthia is, but I do not believe that being sarcastic or having a certain personality trait makes someone stupid. Intelligence and personality are subjective and cannot be measured in such a way.
