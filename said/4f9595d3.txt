bookworm asked We humans have a deeply anthropomorphic tendency to project consciousness and mind into things on the basis of relatively superficial similarity, Should we be worried about machines that merely appear conscious? with hash 4f9595d3

I think it depends on the context. For example, if the machine is passing the Turing test, then yes, we should be concerned. But if the machine is simply performing a task that appears to be conscious, then no, I don't think we should be worried.
