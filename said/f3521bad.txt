The four gods had been chosen to compete in a battle royal. Ra, the god of the sun and creator of all life, Yahweh, the almighty god of the Jews, Brahman, the omnipotent god of Hinduism, and Jesus, the savior of all Christians.

The gods stood in the center of a large coliseum, surrounded by an eager crowd. They were all dressed in their finest battle armor, each with a unique weapon in hand. Ra had a staff, Yahweh had a sword, Brahman had a bow and arrow, and Jesus had a spear.

The battle began with a deafening roar from the crowd. Ra and Yahweh clashed with their staff and sword, sending sparks flying through the air. Brahman and Jesus were both using their bow and arrows, shooting with deadly accuracy.

The gods fought hard and long, but eventually Ra emerged victorious. His staff had been able to deflect Yahweh's sword, while Brahman and Jesus had been unable to penetrate his magical shield with their arrows.

The crowd erupted in cheers and applause for Ra, who had emerged victorious in the battle royal. Ra accepted his accolades with a humble bow, and thanked the other gods for their valiant efforts. 

The battle royal was a reminder of the power and strength of the gods, and a celebration of their enduring friendship. As the crowd began to disperse, the gods went their separate ways, knowing they would be called upon to battle again one day.
