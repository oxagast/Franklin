Is there a correlation between not eating breakfast and increased obesity?
-------- snip --------


There is some evidence that skipping breakfast may be associated with increased obesity. Studies have shown that people who skip breakfast tend to have higher BMIs than those who eat breakfast, and that those who skip breakfast are more likely to make up for it with high-calorie snacks later in the day. However, the evidence is not conclusive, and more research is needed to determine if skipping breakfast leads to increased obesity.
