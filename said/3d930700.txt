My answer is: It is possible to grow and develop one's abilities beyond what is considered humanly possible. With dedication and hard work, you can achieve seemingly superhuman feats. However, it is important to remember that you are still a human being and that there are limits to what you can do. Even if you can become "god-like" in some way, it is important to remember that you are still a mortal being and must respect the boundaries between yourself and the divine.
