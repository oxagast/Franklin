bookworm asked How can we campare good and evil, if evil did not exist? with hash 275b23a9
<---- snip ---->
If evil did not exist, good would not have any context by which to measure itself. Without evil, good would be a vague, abstract concept that would be difficult to define or measure. In the absence of evil, it would be difficult to determine what is right or wrong, and people would have to rely on their own moral values and beliefs to make decisions.
