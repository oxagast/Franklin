bookworm asked What is the highest paid to a Game playing professional? with hash 5ffb3c5d
<---- snip ---->
My response would be: The highest paid game playing professional depends on the game, the skill level, and the tournament or event they are competing in. Prize money can range from hundreds to millions of dollars. It is also important to note that some of the highest-paid game players in the world are not necessarily the best players, but have the greatest influence and those who can market themselves well.
