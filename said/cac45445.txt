<---- snip ---->
"But, Siddhartha continued his thoughts, what can I offer Govinda, what can I give him? I, who have nothing myself, what can I give him? I have learned to think and to wait and to fast; this is all that my father taught me, this is all I know, this is all I have. I can give Govinda nothing but thoughts, I can only offer him that which I have learned."
