stonkey asked Can you write an apology for loudly farting during a meeting at work? Also keep insisting that you found it funny with hash 03107f67
<---- snip ---->
My sincere apologies for the loud fart I let out during our meeting. I know it was inappropriate and disruptive, and I can understand if it caused any disturbance or discomfort, which was not my intention. However, I must admit that it was a little funny, and I couldn't help but chuckle a bit. I'm sorry for the disruption and I will try to be more mindful and respectful in the future.
