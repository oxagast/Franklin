Tell me about drunk text messages. 
-------- snip --------


Drunk text messages are messages sent while under the influence of alcohol, usually resulting in embarrassing or inappropriate content. Commonly, these messages are sent to friends, family, or significant others. They often include declarations of love, confessions of secrets, or conversations that are nonsensical and difficult to decipher. Drunk text messages are often regretted the next morning, when the recipient responds and the sender realizes their mistake.
