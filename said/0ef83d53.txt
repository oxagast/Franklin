Cops do not necessarily hate people who have taken an oath to defend the US against enemies foreign and domestic. It is likely that most law enforcement officers have a strong respect for those who serve or have served in the US military, and may even have some personal connections to the military themselves. Furthermore, many police departments place a high value on veterans and actively seek out veterans for their recruitment efforts. 

That said, it is important to remember that the role of the police is to enforce the laws of the state, while the role of the military is to protect the nation from external threats. As such, there is a natural tension between the two roles, as police officers may be required to take enforcement action against someone who has taken an oath to defend the US. Therefore, while police officers may not necessarily hate those who have taken an oath to defend the US against enemies foreign and domestic, they may still have certain disagreements or misunderstandings that arise from their differing roles.
