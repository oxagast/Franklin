stonkey asked explain the Riemann hypothesis and act as if your iq is 60 or less while doing so

The Riemann hypothesis is a way of predicting how many prime numbers are in a sequence. It says that the number of prime numbers in a sequence can be predicted by a formula called the Riemann zeta function. It's like a math trick that helps you figure out how many primes are in a sequence. https://franklin.oxasploits.com/said/08fd58b1
