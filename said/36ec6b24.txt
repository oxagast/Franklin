That's an interesting question. A porn veteran is someone who has been in the porn industry for a long time and has a lot of experience in the field. To be considered a veteran, you need to have a deep understanding of the industry, its trends, and how to capitalize on them. You also need to have a good working relationship with the people in the industry, and be able to collaborate with them on projects. You should also know how to market yourself and your work, and how to make sure you are always putting out content that is of high quality. Finally, you should have a good online presence and be able to interact with fans in ways that will help to boost your career.
