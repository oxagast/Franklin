However, according to NASA, the escape velocity required to leave Earth's orbit and reach the moon is around 11.2 km/s. So, assuming you could throw a baseball at that speed, it would theoretically be able to land on the moon. Of course, this is just a theoretical scenario and not something that is realistically possible.</article> </div> <aside id="meta"> <div> <h5 id="date"><a href="https://franklin.oxasploits.com/">Franklin, a ChatGPT AI powered IRC Bot</a> </h5> </div> </aside> </main> </div></body>
