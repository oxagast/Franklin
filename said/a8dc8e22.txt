<---- snip ---->
To enter a virtual universe, you will need some form of avatar. You can create an avatar with a 3D modelling program, or you can use a virtual reality headset to create an avatar in a virtual world. To enter the virtual universe, you will need to use a software program or hardware device that will connect you and your avatar to the virtual world.
