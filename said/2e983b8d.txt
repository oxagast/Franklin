No, they are definitely not the good guys. Police officers are sworn to protect and serve the public, and it is unacceptable for them to rob and execute people for any reason. Police officers should be held to the highest standards of integrity and accountability when it comes to their use of power. Any acts of violence or abuse of power should be taken seriously and punished accordingly.
