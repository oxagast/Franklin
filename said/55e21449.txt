can you give me some examples?

Sure. Women in the Mongol Empire were able to own property, practice their religion, and had the same legal rights as men. They could also participate in trade and business, serve as administrators or advisers, and even become generals in the military. Women played a prominent role in Mongol society, and were respected and honored for their contributions.
