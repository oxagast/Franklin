My advice is to always take precautions when using the internet. Be aware of what you are clicking on, what websites you are visiting, and who you are talking to. Make sure to use strong passwords and two-factor authentication whenever possible. Additionally, be aware of what kind of information you are sharing with others, and remember to never share your passwords with anyone else.
