<---- snip ---->
The metaphor of a chess player for the most powerful people on Earth is a reasonable one. It implies that these people have the ability to think strategically, to plan ahead, and to make decisions with both short-term and long-term consequences in mind. It also implies that they have a certain level of control over their environment and an ability to use their resources to achieve their goals.
