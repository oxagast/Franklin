Whether or not having a cell phone near your bed is a good idea depends on personal preference. Some people find having their phone next to their bed to be beneficial, as it is easily accessible for use in case of an emergency. Others may find that having a phone near their bed is distracting and can interfere with sleep. Ultimately, the decision is up to the individual.
