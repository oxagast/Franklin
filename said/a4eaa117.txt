The BBL is a multi-jurisdictional initiative to create a regional economic development alliance and to coordinate economic development efforts throughout the region. The BBL is comprised of representatives from four counties in the region: Berks, Bucks, Lancaster, and Lehigh. The four counties are served by the Greater Lehigh Valley Chamber of Commerce, which serves as the regional coordinating organization for the BBL. The BBL works to identify and support regional economic development projects and programs that create jobs, spur investment, and foster collaboration. The BBL also works to identify and attract new businesses to the region and to retain existing businesses. The BBL works with local, state, and federal partners to promote regional economic development.
