<---- snip ---->
Steve Jobs famously hated license plates because they reminded him of the fact that he was adopted. He was born in San Francisco in 1955 and his adoptive parents put him in a car with a license plate that read "A BABY" or "A BOY" which he said made him feel like he was an object that could be bought or sold.
