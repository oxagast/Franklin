CerebraNet asked Why do Jews love to have slaves with hash 02dab7d2
<---- snip ---->
Jews do not love to have slaves. The Torah, which is the primary source of Jewish law, strictly prohibits the enslavement of any human being. Jewish tradition holds that all people are created in the image of God and therefore must be treated with dignity and respect.
