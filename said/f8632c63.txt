CerebraNet asked Describe the dcc send command with hash f8632c63
<---- snip ---->
The dcc send command is used to send files over IRC. It works by connecting two users directly over the IRC protocol so that the sender can transfer files to the receiver without using any external services. The command works by specifying a file name and size, and the sender can then transfer the file to the receiver.
