<---- snip ---->
Gabriel Colletis is best known for his heterodox economic theories, which challenge the traditional views of neoclassical economics. He is most famous for his development of the Colletis Hypothesis, which proposed that classical economics was based on outdated premises and argued for a new approach to economic theory. He also wrote extensively on the role of the state in the economy, arguing that it should be used to ensure equitable access to resources. In addition, he was a proponent of the concept of a universal basic income and the idea of a "social wage" to reduce economic inequality.
