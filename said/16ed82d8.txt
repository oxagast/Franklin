Hacking a Gibson guitar is not easy, and is not recommended. Gibson guitars are some of the most secure instruments on the market, as they are designed to be virtually impossible to hack. If you are looking to modify your guitar, it is best to take it to a professional luthier who can make any modifications you desire.
