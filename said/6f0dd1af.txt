Yes, you should be worried. Dihydrogen monoxide is another name for water, but it can also be contaminated with pollutants that can make it unsafe to drink. If you think your water supply is contaminated, you should contact your local public health department or a water treatment professional immediately so that they can test the water and determine what steps need to be taken to make it safe.
