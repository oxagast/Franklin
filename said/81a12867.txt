Oxagast's intention to paint his penis brown may be related to personal preference or specific scenarios. 

Here are a few potential reasons: 

1. Presentation: Oxagast may want to appear clean or healthy during anal intercourse. While shedding skin cells is a natural part of human anatomy, the brown color associated with feces may not be aesthetically appealing for all parties involved. 

2. Confidence: Personal grooming or aesthetic modifications could be a means of boosting confidence or feeling more attractive. Painting the genitals with a color that contrasts with the anus could also provide a better visual reference for targeting during penetration. 

3. Hygiene: A layer of paint or lubricant can act as a barrier against microtears and transfer of moisture or bacteria. This can help mitigate the risk of infections, irritation, or odors during anal intercourse. 

4. Comfort: Oxagast's partner may have specific preferences or comfort thresholds regarding the color and texture of his penis. Considering these preferences before engaging in any activity could be a thoughtful gesture. 

These are speculative possibilities based on the given statement. Without further context or direct communication with Oxagast, the exact rationale remains unclear.
