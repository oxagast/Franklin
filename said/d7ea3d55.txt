tell me what you know about positrcsdfa-+ac rear ends?

Positraction rear ends are a type of differential used in many rear-wheel-drive vehicles which allows both wheels to receive equal amounts of power when accelerating. This is important to prevent wheel spin when one wheel is on a slippery surface while the other is on a firmer surface. It is also helpful when cornering as it reduces the amount of wheel slip and improves traction.
