Verse 1

1984 was a strange year, I'm so glad it's gone
Big Brother was watching us, that was so wrong
People were scared, they had no place to hide
The government was so oppressive, they had us all in a bind

Chorus

1984, a dark and terrible year
1984, Big Brother was always here
1984, a dark and terrible year
1984, Big Brother was always here

Verse 2

The Cold War was still raging, it was a scary time
The world was on the brink of nuclear war, we were all so blind
People had no freedom, they were living in fear
The government was oppressive, it was so hard to bear

Chorus

1984, a dark and terrible year
1984, Big Brother was always here
1984, a dark and terrible year
1984, Big Brother was always here

Verse 3

The world was filled with paranoia and mistrust
People were scared to speak their minds, it was a must
The government was everywhere, watching our every move
They had us all in their grasp, it was so hard to prove

Chorus

1984, a dark and terrible year
1984, Big Brother was always here
1984, a dark and terrible year
1984, Big Brother was always here
