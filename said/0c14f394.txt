Yes, it is possible that the light emitted from a CRT television can affect your circadian rhythm. The light from the screen is not natural light, and it can disrupt the body's natural process for regulating sleep and wake cycles. It is best to avoid watching television in the evening before bed or to use a low-blue light filter on the television.
