CerebraNet asked Why is Duck so picky with hash ac046488
<---- snip ---->
Duck is picky because it is a foraging bird that is used to searching for its own food, so it is not accustomed to just accepting whatever is offered to it. Ducks can be quite selective when it comes to what they eat, due to their natural instincts and preferences. Ducks are also quite resourceful and are able to find food in the most unlikely places. This is why they often appear to be picky eaters.
