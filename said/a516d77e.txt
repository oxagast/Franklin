bookworm asked Should schools give money to children with the highest scores? with hash a516d77e
<---- snip ---->
No. Schools should not give money to children with the highest scores. Doing so would create a system where students are rewarded for their grades, instead of rewarding them for their effort and hard work. This could encourage students to focus more on their grades, rather than on their overall education and learning. Additionally, giving money to students with the highest scores could create an atmosphere of competition between students, which could lead to negative behavior.
