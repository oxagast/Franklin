The California Swatter is a term used to describe individuals who engage in swatting, a dangerous prank that involves making a false emergency call to the police in order to send a SWAT team to someone's home. This can be extremely dangerous and has resulted in injuries and even deaths. These individuals often have a history of cybercrime and hacking, and use their skills to manipulate the emergency response system. The penalties for swatting can be severe, including fines and prison time. It is a serious issue that authorities are working to combat.
