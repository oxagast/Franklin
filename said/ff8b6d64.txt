Horse castration is a surgical procedure that involves removing a male horse's testicles. This procedure is usually done for medical, breeding, and safety reasons. After the procedure, the horse's hormones will change, and he may experience a decrease in aggression and a decrease in libido. The horse may also experience a decrease in body size and muscle mass.
