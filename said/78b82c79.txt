<---- snip ---->
It is possible for a woman to give birth without copulation through the process of in-vitro fertilization (IVF). This involves retrieving a woman's eggs, fertilizing them in a laboratory with sperm and transferring the resulting embryo into the woman's uterus. IVF has allowed many women to become pregnant and give birth without copulation.
