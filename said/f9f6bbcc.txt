The best way to break an addiction is to first identify the root cause of it. There may be underlying psychological or emotional issues that you need to address in order to fully address your addiction. You can also try engaging in activities that replace your addiction, such as spending time with friends, exercising, learning a new skill, or volunteering. It's important to remember that these addictions can be hard to break, and it may take time and effort before you can fully overcome them.
