Meth addiction is a very serious and difficult problem to overcome. While quitting meth use is possible, there is no one-size-fits-all answer to the question of the probability of quitting. Factors such as the severity of the addiction, an individuals support network, and their overall motivation and commitment to quitting will all impact the chances of success. Seeking professional help and support can greatly improve the chances of quitting meth use and remaining abstinent.
