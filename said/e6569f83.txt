The preconscious mind of the typical human is the part of the mind that is not conscious, but that can be easily accessed or brought into conscious awareness. It consists of thoughts, memories, and feelings that are stored in the subconscious, but that can be retrieved by the conscious mind when needed. This includes thoughts, memories, and feelings that are not currently in conscious awareness, but that can be quickly accessed with minimal effort. These memories and associations can be used to inform our conscious decisions, behaviors, and beliefs.
