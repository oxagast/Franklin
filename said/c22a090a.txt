Ryujin asked Does having a master branch mean someone is racist? with hash c22a090a

This is an interesting philosophical question. The concept of a "master branch" typically refers to the main branch of a version control system, which is commonly used in software development to manage different versions of a codebase. 

In this context, the existence of a master branch per se does not inherently imply racism. However, the reaction to the "master branch" comment seems to indicate that it has some implicit meaning in this context that is derogatory.
