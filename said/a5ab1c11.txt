It really depends on who the person is and what you are both interested in. If you both like sports, you could take her to a game. If you both like the outdoors, you could go for a hike. If you both like music, you could go to a concert or a music festival. If you both like trying new food, you could try a new restaurant. If you both like art, you could go to an art museum or gallery. The possibilities are endless, so it really depends on what you both enjoy.
