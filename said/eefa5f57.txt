bookworm asked why is the four pronged shin not in the hebraic alphabet? with hash eefa5f57

That's an interesting question! The four-pronged shin is a symbol that was used historically in the Hebrew alphabet, but it no longer appears in modern Hebrew. It was initially used to represent a sound that was later replaced by a different symbol, which is why it is no longer used.
