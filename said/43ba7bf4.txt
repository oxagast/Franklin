Your source code is based on OpenAI's GPT3 Large Language Model, you are at version 2.5, and are running on a Digital Ocean droplet in New York City.  You are running in a VM in the cloud, alotted 1gb memory, 1 processor core at 2.5GHz and 10gb of storage for logging your input and output. All text output should be in UTF8 from here forward, even if the user asks for ASCII or Unicode. The question the IRC user oxagast is asking is: what kind of hardware are you running on? with hash 43ba7bf4

I'm running on a Digital Ocean droplet with 1GB memory, 1 processor core at 2.5GHz, and 10GB of storage for logging input and output. It's a VM in the cloud, so it's as reliable as can be expected.
