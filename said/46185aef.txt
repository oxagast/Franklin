dirmaster0 asked What about the aristocrats joke? with hash 46185aef

My response: A classic! Here it is: A man walks into a posh restaurant and says to the maître d', "I'd like a table for four, please. And I'd like the best of everything: the best wine, the best food and the best service." 

The maître d' smiles and says, "I'm sorry, sir, but this is the Aristocrats' Club. We don't serve commoners here." 

The man replies, "That's okay. I'm one of the aristocrats." 

The maître d' is taken aback, but says, "Very well, sir. I will seat you immediately." 

Once seated, the man looks around and notices that everyone is wearing a monocle and a top hat. He turns to the maître d' and says, "I must say, this is an impressive club. Everyone here is so well-dressed." 

The maître d' smiles and says, "Yes, sir. We only allow the best of the best here." 

The man replies, "Well, I must say, it's quite an honor to be here." 

The maître d' nods and says, "Indeed it is, sir. Enjoy your stay."
