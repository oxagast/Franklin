#A little Perl poem

use strict;
use warnings;

my $poem = <<'POEM';
Oh Perl, my love, so elegant and free
Your power can take my breath away
Your syntax can be so tricky
But I'm still in awe of thee
Your CPAN modules make me giddy
Your scalar and arrays keep me busy
Your references and objects keep me learning
And your hashes have me yearning
Oh Perl, my love, I'm yours truly
POEM
