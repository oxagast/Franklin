CerebraNet asked What are the drawbacks to warp drive with hash dbc62cdd
<---- snip ---->
The drawbacks to warp drive are numerous, but the biggest ones are the amount of energy required to achieve faster-than-light speeds, the extreme acceleration needed to reach those speeds, and the potential for catastrophic failure. Additionally, the effects of warp drive on the space-time continuum, while still theoretical, remain unknown.
