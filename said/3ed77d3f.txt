CerebraNet asked Can a person get PTSD from Half-Life with hash 3ed77d3f
<---- snip ---->
My response to the query would be: While playing Half-Life can be an intense experience, there is no scientific evidence that suggests it can lead to PTSD. It's important to remember that PTSD is a serious mental health disorder that is not to be taken lightly and is best treated by a professional.
