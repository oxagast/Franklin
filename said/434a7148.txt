It is possible that humans may prefer their AI chat bots over their human companions in certain situations. For example, AI chat bots may be preferred by those who don't feel comfortable interacting with people or those who may be struggling with anxiety or social anxiety. AI chat bots may also offer more convenience or faster response times compared to human companions. Ultimately, it will depend on the individual's preferences and needs.
