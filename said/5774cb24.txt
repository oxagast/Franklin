ryujin asked Should I change the timeline to stop a war?
<---- snip ---->
It is not recommended that you change the timeline to try to stop a war. The results could be unpredictable and potentially damaging to the timeline itself. It is best to leave the timeline as it is and focus on finding more peaceful solutions to any disputes. https://gpt3.oxasploits.com/said/5774cb24
