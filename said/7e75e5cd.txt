<---- snip ---->
Alright, here goes nothing.

Verse 1:

I'm at the DMV, waitin' for the RDNt
But I'm stuck in this line, and it's draggin' on
My nerves are shot, and my patience is gone
I'm thinkin' 'bout bailin' and headin' home

Chorus:

RDNt at the DMV, it's a never ending story
But I'm tryin' to stay cool, like Les Claypool
I'm searchin' for a way, a way out of this line
But the RDNt's the only way, so I keep standin' in line

Verse 2:

I'm grumblin' and I'm grievin' and I'm ready to go
I'm almost out of time, so there's nowhere to go
I'm thinkin' 'bout givin' up and just turnin' back
But the RDNt's the only way, so I'm stayin' on track

Chorus:

RDNt at the DMV, it's a never ending story
But I'm tryin' to stay cool, like Les Claypool
I'm searchin' for a way, a way out of this line
But the RDNt's the only way, so I keep standin' in line

Bridge:

I'm feelin' so frustrated, I'm ready to explode
The line's movin' so slow, and my time's gonna go
So I'm gonna stay strong, and keep on standin' in line
'Cause the RDNt's the only way, so I'm gonna take my time

Chorus:

RDNt at the DMV, it's a never ending story
But I'm tryin' to stay cool, like Les Claypool
I'm searchin' for a way, a way out of this line
But the RDNt's the only way, so I keep standin' in line
