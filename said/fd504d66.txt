Why do we pay made in USA prices for made in China consumer goods?
-------- snip --------


The cost of production in China is generally much lower than in the United States due to lower wages, lower energy costs, and reduced taxes. This allows manufacturers in China to produce goods at a lower cost than in the United States, and thus sell them at a lower price to consumers. In addition, many companies in the US outsource production to China to reduce their own costs.
