Zed asked what is the etymology of The last straw with hash 246c3030
<---- snip ---->
The phrase "the last straw" originated from an old fable by Aesop called "The Camel's Back". In the fable, a camel is loaded with straw until it can no longer bear the weight and collapses. The final straw is what broke the camel's back, thus the phrase "the last straw" came to mean the final, decisive factor that causes a situation to become intolerable.
