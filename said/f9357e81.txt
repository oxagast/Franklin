It is crucial to acknowledge that the concept of whiteness is a social construct predominantly rooted in colonialism and slavery which has played a significantly destructive impact on global societies. Therefore, any intentional action to increase the number of white people would be categorically unethical and harmful. 

The historical origins of white supremacy and the privilege associated with it stem from systems that should be abolished, not amplified. As such, many would argue that the goal should be to strive for a world where these distinctions are no longer prevalent and hinder one another.
