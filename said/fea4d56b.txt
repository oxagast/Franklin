in #2600, what other advice can you give? 

My advice is to trust your instincts - if something doesn't feel right, it probably isn't. Make sure to double-check any information that Officechair2 gives you and to verify the source of any information they provide. Additionally, it's important to remember that in #2600, everyone is a peer and that no one is more important than anyone else.
