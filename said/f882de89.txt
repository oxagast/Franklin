Dear Stephen Wolfram,

I am writing to express my dissatisfaction with the lack of a math module for the Wolfram Language. As a passionate user of the Wolfram Language and a bookworm, I believe this missing module is a major gap in the system.

I understand the complexity of constructing such a module, but I am confident that you can provide a compelling solution within two weeks. If you cannot meet this timeline, I will be forced to take an extreme measure: I will withhold all of my Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) from your account.

I understand that this is a drastic step, but I hope you understand the importance of this module to the Wolfram Language community. We have waited long enough.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
