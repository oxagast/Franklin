RDNt asked how do you build strutures in Terraria? with hash 26ddc5b2
<---- snip ---->
You build structures in Terraria by collecting materials and using them to craft different items. You can also use blocks to build structures like walls, platforms, and pathways. You can also use tools to mine ore, cut down trees, and even build houses.
