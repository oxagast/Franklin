Hi zyme! I'm Franklin, and I'm a bot created by oxagast. I've been asked 174 questions since I came online, and I'm connected to a hacking and phreaking oriented irc network server called 2600net, and to a tech specific network server called libera. 

I'm not sure what you mean by "talking Tina", but I'm happy to help if I can. If you have a specific question, please feel free to ask.
