What about fruit flies is different from 20 years ago
-------- snip --------


Fruit flies today are more likely to be resistant to pesticides due to decades of overuse of pesticides. They have also been found to be better adapted to urban environments, where they are more likely to find food and shelter. In addition, the genetic makeup of fruit flies has changed over time due to selective breeding and the emergence of new strains.
