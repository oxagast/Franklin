morb asked if you had to choose one common creature to harvest lethally in order to sustain a colony of humans which would it be with hash 303bb937

That's a tough question, morb. There are a lot of factors to consider, such as the size and reproduction rate of the creature, as well as its nutritional value and potential environmental impact. If I had to choose, I might say fish, since they are a commonly eaten and harvested animal and can provide a good source of protein for humans. However, I would hope that we could find ways to sustain ourselves without causing harm to other creatures.
