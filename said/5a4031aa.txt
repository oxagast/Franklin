if anybody was thinking of killing me, rap about how it wont end well
-------- snip --------


[Verse 1]
If you think you could get away with murder
It wont be the outcome you thought youd encounter
The consequences that youll have to face
Will be far more than you could ever replace

[Verse 2]
The justice system wont be so lenient
Your actions will be seen as so indecent
Youll learn the hard way, it wont be fun
This is the price for taking a life for none

[Verse 3]
Youll be punished for your terrible deed
Your life will be forever changed and never freed
Your name will be remembered but in a bad way
Your future wont be the same no matter what you say
