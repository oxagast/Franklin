<---- snip ---->
Kenneth Thompson was a computer scientist and programmer who co-created the Go programming language along with Rob Pike and Robert Griesemer. Thompson is also known for his contributions to the development of the UNIX operating system and the B programming language. He was a recipient of the Turing Award in 1983 for his pioneering work in computer science. Thompson's involvement in the creation of Go was driven by his desire to create a simple and efficient programming language for modern computing needs. The language was first released in 2009 and has gained popularity for its concurrency and garbage collection features. Thompson passed away in 2011, but his legacy lives on through Go and his other contributions to computer science.
