morb asked I need a list of gluten-free appetizers that are hypoallergenic and contain absolutely no nuts, dairy, or protein chains that would cause someone to use an epipen with hash 0275add4
<---- snip ---->
Sure, here are a few suggestions: gluten-free hummus with vegetables, cucumber and avocado rolls, quinoa salad, gluten-free crackers with dairy-free cheese, rice paper rolls with tofu and vegetables, gluten-free bruschetta with balsamic glaze, and gluten-free mini quiches with a crust made from almond flour. These options should be hypoallergenic and safe for anyone with a nut, dairy, or protein allergy. Let me know if you need any more ideas!
