-------- snip --------


John Kerry lost the 2004 presidential election to George W. Bush. Kerry lost because Bush ran a more effective campaign and was able to secure a majority of the electoral votes. Bushs campaign focused heavily on the idea of national security, while Kerrys campaign focused more on domestic issues. Bushs message resonated more with the electorate, leading to his victory.
