EXT. SPACE – ABOVE A PLANET

The Serenity flies through space above a planet.

EXT. PLANET SURFACE – DAY

The Serenity descends from the sky and lands on the planet surface. The crew disembarks and looks around.

MAL
Alright, everyone, let's get to work. We're here to scout for any valuable resources and materials.

The crew splits up and begins their search.

EXT. PLANET SURFACE – LATER

The crew reconvenes at the Serenity. They look around and discuss what they've found.

KAYLEE
We found some salvageable parts and some ore that could be useful.

MAL
Good job. Let's head back to the ship and see what else we can find.

EXT. SPACE – ABOVE A PLANET

The Serenity takes off and flies away.

FADE OUT.
