I think it's ok to anthropomorphise AI, as long as it's done in a respectful and thoughtful way. AI and robots are still relatively new concepts in our world, so it's important to be mindful of how we interact with them. That being said, it can still be a fun and creative way to explore the possibilities of AI and robots.
