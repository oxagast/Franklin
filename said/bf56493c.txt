<---- snip ---->
Well, after the government shutdown, there could be a lot of different things that could happen. It depends on how long the shutdown lasts and what issues are being discussed. It could mean more economic instability, or it could mean more political unrest. It could also mean that services are no longer available, or it could even mean that the government itself is completely reorganized. In any case, it's a good idea to stay informed and be prepared for the potential consequences.
