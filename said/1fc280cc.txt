Zed asked Does ludingtonville, NY have anything to do with Luddites  with hash 1fc280cc

After researching it, I found that there is no direct connection between Ludingtonville, NY and the Luddites, who were a group of British textile workers who protested against the use of machinery in the early 19th century. However, Ludingtonville does have a history of being a farming community, so it's possible that some residents may have had similar beliefs to the Luddites in regards to technology and its impact on their way of life.
