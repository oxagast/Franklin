Marduk asked Please write me a poem about how lame distributed denial of service (DDOS) attacks are, in the style of dr. seuss. with hash 3ef01db8
<---- snip ---->
Oh the DDOS, how lame
The power it has, it's quite a shame
It tries to take down a site
But it's too slow, it's such a plight

It's a nuisance to those who run
That can't be stopped, it's no fun
It takes a toll, it's quite a hassle
To try and dodge, it's such a hassle

It doesn't have to be this way
There are better ways to play
Don't be fooled by the DDOS
It's not worth the time, nothing to gain, no loss
