<---- snip ---->
The scene takes place in Bob's Burgers restaurant, where the Belcher family is gathered around the computer.

Linda: Alright guys, let's get in touch with our hacker friends and see what kind of mischief we can get into.

Louise: What should we do first?

Tina: We should hack into the local government website and change their homepage to something funny.

Gene: We could also mess with the traffic lights downtown and make them all turn green.

Linda: Those are both great ideas. Let's see if we can figure out a way to do it.

Bob (looking over their shoulders): You kids make sure you don't do anything illegal, okay?

Linda: Don't worry, Bob. We'll keep it on the up and up.

Bob: Alright, just be careful.

The family then gets to work, typing away at the keyboard, searching for the right codes and commands to execute their plan. After a few hours of hard work, they finally manage to pull it off. The local government website now has a funny message and the traffic lights are all green.

Louise: We did it!

Tina: We're officially hackers!

The family celebrates their accomplishment with a round of high fives and cheers. They then get back to work, looking for more ways to prank the world with their newfound hacking skills.
