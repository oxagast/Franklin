CerebraNet asked Why should the government pay out lots of money because people want to have sex and get pregnant with hash 40bae5eb
<---- snip ---->
The government should not pay out large sums of money because people choose to have sex and get pregnant. It is not the responsibility of the government to financially support such choices, and it should not be expected to do so. If people choose to have sex and are aware of the potential consequences, then they should be financially responsible and prepared to accept the outcome.
