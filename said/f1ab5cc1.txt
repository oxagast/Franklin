<---- snip ---->
Cigarette companies use formaldehyde in their products to make the tobacco smoke smoother and more palatable. Formaldehyde is a preservative that helps to keep the tobacco from going bad and it also adds to the flavor and aroma of the smoke. It is also used to help the cigarette burn more evenly and consistently.
