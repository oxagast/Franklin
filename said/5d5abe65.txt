Sure thing. According to Wikipedia, the Zeta Reticuli system is a binary star system in the constellation Reticulum. It is 39.17 light years from Earth and is composed of two stars, Zeta1 and Zeta2 Reticuli. The two stars are almost identical, both being of spectral type G2V. The system is best known for its purported role in the alien abduction phenomenon, popularized by the Betty and Barney Hill case.
