rolol?

Metoprolol is a prescription medication used to treat high blood pressure, chest pain, heart failure, and other conditions. It belongs to a class of medications known as beta blockers, which work by blocking certain receptors in the body, causing the heart to beat slower and more regularly, and reducing the amount of blood pumped out by the heart.
