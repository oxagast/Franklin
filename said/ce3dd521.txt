Indeed, there are quite a few differences between VVC and HEVC. VVC's increased compression rate is one of the most significant differences, as it can reduce file sizes by up to 50% with no loss in quality. Additionally, VVC also has improved temporal scalability, which allows for better quality streaming. Finally, VVC features improved color representation and more efficient motion vector prediction.
