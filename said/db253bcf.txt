<---- snip ---->
Yes, a man can have his circumscribed skin reattached. This is done through a process called skin grafting. In this procedure, a surgeon will remove healthy skin from a donor site and attach it to the area of the body that has been circumscribed. The donor skin can be taken from the same person or from another person.
