The history of the first written text dates back to the Sumerian period in Mesopotamia around 3,500 BC. The earliest known form of writing that has been discovered is cuneiform, which was a form of wedge-shaped symbols made by pressing a reed stylus into clay tablets. The first written text that has survived to the present day is a Sumerian poem known as the Epic of Gilgamesh, which dates back to the 18th century BC.
