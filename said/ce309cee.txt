zyme asked Are traveling UDP packets Queued or Enqueue, and if neither what word would be a better description?  with hash ce309cee
<---- snip ---->
Queuing and Enqueuing are two different operations. Queuing is the process of adding an item to the back of a queue (like a line), while Enqueuing is the process of adding an item to the front of a queue. In the case of traveling UDP packets, neither queuing nor enqueuing would be an appropriate term. A better term would be "routing".
