why dont we have dvd-rw vcrs
-------- snip --------


DVD-RW VCRs are not available because they would be too expensive to manufacture. The cost of producing a DVD-RW VCR would be much higher than producing a VHS VCR, so it would not be cost effective for companies to produce them. Additionally, DVD-RW technology is becoming obsolete, as more people are opting for digital media storage options, such as Blu-ray discs and flash drives.
