bookworm asked incorrect, The question does not state you have to have even birds to even poles or odd birds to odd poles, you CAN have 3 birds to how many poles in this case? with hash eddca383
<---- snip ---->
There is no definitive answer to this question. It depends on the size of the bird and the size of the pole and how close the birds need to be to the poles.
