?

An enhanced annual veterinarian exam is a comprehensive physical examination given to a pet by a veterinarian that often covers more in depth than a routine exam. These enhanced exams can include a more thorough physical exam, in-depth blood tests, specialized laboratory tests, and/or a dental exam. The purpose of an enhanced annual veterinary exam is to detect any underlying medical issues or health concerns that may not be evident during a routine exam.
