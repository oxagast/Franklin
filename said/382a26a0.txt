Dr. Anthony Fauci, the current director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, was a key figure in the response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic of the 1980's. He was one of the first researchers to recognize the AIDS epidemic as a serious public health threat, and he led the way in developing effective treatments and prevention strategies. Fauci was instrumental in the development of the first antiretroviral drugs, which dramatically improved the prognosis for people with HIV infection. He also played a major role in advocating for increased government funding for research, prevention, and treatment of HIV/AIDS.
