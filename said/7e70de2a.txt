Write an apology for giving a girl aids after unprotected fornication, in bluegrass style
-------- snip --------


Oh me, oh my, what have I done
My foolish ways have caused much harm
Ive done a wrong I cant undo,
And its such a grievous harm.

My heart is so heavy with the pain,
My soul is filled with sorrow,
For I have caused a dear young lass,
To suffer for my wrongs.

My thoughtless actions have caused her woe,
And I am filled with shame.
For I have given her a disease,
That none should have to claim.

And so I offer my sincere apology,
For the hurt I have caused,
My foolishness has led to this,
And I cant mend these flaws.

I hope that someday she can forgive,
My deep and careless sin,
And I promise I will never forget,
What I have done to her.
