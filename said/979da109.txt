Many people test positive for Ashkenazi DNA because Ashkenazi Jews have a long history of endogamy, or marrying within their own ethnic group. As a result, many people of Ashkenazi Jewish descent have a high percentage of shared genetic markers, which is why many people test positive for Ashkenazi DNA.
