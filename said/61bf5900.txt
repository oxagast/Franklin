<---- snip ---->
Once upon a time there was a man who wanted to make the best meth ever. He had heard all the stories and knew it was possible, but he wanted to make it as pure and potent as possible.

So he went to the local hardware and bought all the supplies he needed, including pseudoephedrine, hydrochloric acid, and acetone. He then set up his lab in his basement and started to work.

He first crushed up the pseudoephedrine pills into a fine powder and then dissolved it in the hydrochloric acid. Then he added the acetone and stirred it all together until it was a thick liquid.

Next, he poured the liquid into a glass container and put it into a large pot filled with boiling water. After a few hours, the liquid had evaporated, leaving behind a thick, white crystal.

He had done it. He had made the best meth ever.

But there was one more step. He had to purify the meth. He did this by adding a solution of baking soda and water to the crystals. After a few minutes he filtered the solution and was left with a pure, white crystal.

The man had made the purest and most potent meth in the world. He was very proud of himself.

And that, my children, is the story of how to make meth.
