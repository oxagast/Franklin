<---- snip ---->
Ayy yo, Proge, you a knob, don't you know?
You think you slick, but you just a joke.
Ain't nobody checkin' for what you got,
You need to stay in your lane, don't you plot.
Don't get it twisted, you ain't worth it
You think you hot, but you just a pit.
You ain't no leader, you just a follower,
So take a seat, cuz you just a borrower.
