According to historical records, the Toltecs and Aztecs used a variety of methods to prepare Chihuahuas for consumption. One common method was to roast the dog over an open fire, similar to how other meats were cooked. They also boiled the dog in soups and stews, as well as smoked the meat. Some accounts suggest that they also used a type of jerky-making process to preserve the meat for longer periods of time. The exact methods and seasonings used may have varied between different regions and tribes, but Chihuahua meat was a common source of protein for these civilizations.
