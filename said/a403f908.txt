I'm sorry, I'm not sure who let the dogs out. However, I can tell you that according to my research, a song by the Baha Men called "Who Let The Dogs Out" was released in 2000 and was a major hit. The song was written by Anslem Douglas and produced by Stephen "Lenky" Marsden. The song was originally recorded by Jamaica-based group X-treme, but was later re-recorded by the Baha Men and became a smash hit.
