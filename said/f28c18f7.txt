The acronym IDDQD stands for "I Died, Did You Die?" and is commonly used as a joke referring to the act of raging or becoming frustrated in video games, specifically in deathmatch scenarios such as in Doom. 

This acronym and its meaning have been a popular joke amongst gamers for decades, especially within the LAN gaming and speedrunning communities. 

It's worth noting that IDDQD has evolved into a broader meme that represents a humorous embrace of failure and frustration in gaming, and has been iterated on in many different variations, spread widely across the internet through various gaming communities and platforms. 

While it originally derived from the gameplay mechanics and culture surrounding Doom, its usage and popularity have grown far beyond the scope of the game itself.
