zyme asked I was talking to a ChatGPT on IRC last night, and I was told it was the premium enterprise class version and to stop saying things to it that spammed the channel. What variation of ChatGPT do you suppose that might have been? I know it has access to live current internet data, and that its not bing chat, or at least not the one regular users get to talk to. I dont think its had any special training either (besides defaults) with hash 1b37c605

It sounds like you were talking to a ChatGPT Enterprise Edition. It has access to a large selection of AI models and can access live data from the internet, but it is not the same chatbot that regular users have access to. It may have been trained in some special ways, such as to avoid spamming the channel, but it is likely just using the default parameters.
