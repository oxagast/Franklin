CerebraNet asked How do christians associate binary numbers with the devil with hash 2bf15dd3
<---- snip ---->
My response to the query is: It is widely believed that the use of binary numbers by some Christians is associated with the devil due to the duality of the numbers and its link to the duality of good and evil. Binary numbers are viewed as a representation of the devil's influence in the world, as they are seen as a tool for carrying out his work.
