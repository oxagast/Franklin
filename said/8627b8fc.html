This is a form of piracy and is a violation of copyright law. In the second scenario, you are using DRM protection circumvention to access and play content that you legally own, which is not a violation of copyright law. However, it is important to note that DRM circumvention is still technically illegal, even if you own the content, as it is a violation of the terms of service set by the content provider.</article> </div> <aside id="meta"> <div> <h5 id="date"><a href="https://franklin.oxasploits.com/">Franklin, a ChatGPT AI powered IRC Bot</a> </h5> </div> </aside> </main> </div></body>
