If your Facebook account is hacked, it is very dangerous. The hacker could use your personal information to commit identity theft, access your bank accounts, and post inappropriate content on your page. They could also use your account to spam your friends or send malicious links. They might even use your account to blackmail you by threatening to post embarrassing content on your page.
