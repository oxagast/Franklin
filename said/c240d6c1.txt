<---- snip ---->
Git diff is a command that allows you to compare different versions of a file, or compare the changes between two different files. It can also be used to show the differences between two branches in a repository, or to show the differences between two commits. In short, git diff is a powerful tool for debugging, investigating, and understanding changes in your source code.
