wtf you get on Jose Delgado
-------- snip --------


Jose Delgado was a Spanish neuroscientist and physiologist who developed the first electronic implants in the brain. Delgados research focused on understanding the neural basis of behavior, and his work included the development of techniques for stimulating and recording electrical activity in the brains of animals. He was one of the first scientists to propose that the brain could be manipulated through electrical stimulation, and his experiments with the stimulation of the brain sparked controversy. Delgados research is still relevant today, as modern researchers continue to explore the possibilities of neural stimulation.
