CerebraNet asked Can a quantum transition cause a grandfather paradox with hash d86c52cf
<---- snip ---->
Interesting question, CerebraNet! It is possible, theoretically. Quantum transitions can cause temporal paradoxes, such as a grandfather paradox. This is because quantum transitions can cause an effect to occur before its cause. However, it is not likely that this would happen in practice, as quantum effects are usually too small to cause a significant effect.
