The process of creating a neovagina (a surgically constructed vagina) from a penis is called penile inversion vaginoplasty. This procedure involves removing the penis and testicles, creating a vagina-like structure from the existing penile tissue, and reconstructing the labia and clitoral hood. The procedure typically involves skin grafts from other parts of the body to help build the vaginal walls.
