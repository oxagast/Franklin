Why do facebook users hate responsibility
-------- snip --------


Facebook users often hate responsibility because it can be difficult to take on and it can be seen as a burden. Additionally, many people on social media want to feel free and unrestricted, and taking on responsibility may limit their freedom. People may also be intimidated by the thought of having to take on responsibility and the potential consequences of not meeting expectations.
