xibalba asked why do the iranian people hate jimmy carter
<---- snip ---->
Jimmy Carter was the President of the United States during the Iranian Revolution in 1979. During his presidency, Carter allowed the exiled Iranian leader, the Shah of Iran, to enter the United States for medical treatment. The Iranian people were deeply offended and saw this as a sign of disrespect. The move also angered religious leaders in Iran, who were already opposed to the Shahâ€™s rule. This contributed to the growing animosity between the Iranian people and Jimmy Carter. https://franklin.oxasploits.com/said/d64ce405
