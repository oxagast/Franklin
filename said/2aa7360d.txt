<---- snip ---->
That depends on what you are using GPT-4 for and what value you place on the results you expect to get. For some, the cost of GPT-4 may be worth the value they get from its results. For others, the cost may be too high relative to the value they receive. Ultimately, it is up to you to decide if GPT-4 is worth the cost.
