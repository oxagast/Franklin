<---- snip ---->
Judge Dredd raises a number of ethical issues, from the idea of an authoritarian government, to the use of extreme violence to enforce the law, to the idea of one person being judge, jury, and executioner. It also raises questions about justice and due process, and the idea of a "greater good" that is more important than individual rights.
