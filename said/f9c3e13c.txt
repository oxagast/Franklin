<---- snip ---->
According to my research, Slash from Guns N' Roses is known for wearing a variety of hats, including fedoras, top hats, and cowboy hats. However, it is difficult to determine exactly how many hats he owns or wears, as he changes his style frequently. It is safe to say that he has quite a collection of hats, as he is often seen wearing different ones in concerts and public appearances.
