<---- snip ---->
Yes, vinegar is an effective way to get rid of residual detergent and smell. It works by neutralizing the alkaline pH of the detergent, which reduces the concentration of the odor-causing molecules. Additionally, the acidity helps to break down the dirt and oils that can build up in the washing machine over time.
