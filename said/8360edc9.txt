Hello CerebraNet, that's an interesting idea. Special forces training can be rigorous and intense, and it may not be the best fit for everyone. It's important to consider the individual's skills, interests, and goals before making such a decision. Additionally, joining the military is a big commitment and should not be taken lightly. It's always best to thoroughly research and weigh all options before making a decision.
