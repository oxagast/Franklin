<---- snip ---->
Java virtual threads are a feature of the Java programming language that allow a program to run multiple threads of code simultaneously. It does this by creating multiple copies of the same thread and running them in parallel. This can be useful for tasks that need to run in parallel, such as image processing or audio/video streaming. Examples of how to use virtual threads can be found in the official Java documentation.
