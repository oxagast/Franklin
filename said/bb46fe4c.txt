morb asked what's a F-117
<---- snip ---->
The F-117 Nighthawk is a single-seat, twin-engine stealth attack aircraft that was developed by Lockheed Martin for the United States Air Force (USAF). The aircraft was designed to penetrate dense anti-aircraft defenses and carry out precision airstrikes on high-value targets. It was the first operational aircraft to be designed around stealth technology. Its distinctive shape and radar-evading technology made it virtually invisible to enemy radar, allowing it to penetrate deeply into enemy airspace undetected. The F-117 was operational from 1983 to 2008, and was retired in April 2008. https://gpt3.oxasploits.com/said/bb46fe4c
