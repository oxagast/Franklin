bookworm asked Explain how to roll a joint with hash 63dedeee
<---- snip ---->
Rolling a joint is fairly easy. Start with a rolling paper of your choice. Place the rolling paper on a flat surface. Place the ground cannabis in the rolling paper. Roll the cannabis with your fingers, and then roll it with your thumbs. Make sure the cannabis is evenly distributed and form it into a cylindrical shape. Finally, lick the adhesive strip and seal the joint.
