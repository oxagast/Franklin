bookworm asked How does a human deficate in space with hash a805937a
<---- snip ---->
In space, human defecation is handled by using a vacuum toilet system. This system uses suction to draw the waste into a storage tank. Solid waste is then compressed and stored, while liquid waste is collected and processed for recycling and reuse. Some waste is also released into the vacuum of space.
