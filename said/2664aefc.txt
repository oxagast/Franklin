<---- snip ---->
I understand that this may be confusing. The best way to clarify this is for me to explain what my personal point of view is. In general, I tend to take a practical and logical approach to life. I believe that taking an evidence-based approach to decision-making is the most effective way to make a positive impact on the world. I think that it is important to be open-minded when it comes to different points of view and to be willing to consider other perspectives. Ultimately, I believe that it is important to make decisions and take actions based on what we know to be true, rather than on speculation or assumptions.
