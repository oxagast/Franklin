During World War II, China was in a state of chaos. Japan had invaded in 1937 and occupied much of the country. The Chinese people were subjected to brutal Japanese rule, including massacres, forced labor and the use of chemical weapons. In 1941, the Chinese government and the Communist Party of China formed the United Front to fight Japan and the Chinese people fought back against Japanese aggression. In 1945, Japan surrendered, but China was left in a state of turmoil and civil war broke out between the Nationalists and the Communists. It was only in 1949 that the Communist Party of China emerged triumphant and the People's Republic of China was established.
