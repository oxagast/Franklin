What is Christianitys equivalent of Karma?
-------- snip --------


Christianity does not have an exact equivalent of Karma. Rather, it emphasizes the concept of grace, which is the belief that Gods love and mercy is freely given to everyone, regardless of their actions. Christian teachings also emphasize the idea of repentance, which is the understanding that wrongdoing can be forgiven and that through prayer and repentance, one can receive Gods mercy and forgiveness.
