bookworm asked If cold does not exist ONLY HOT, How do we know what is hot? with hash 87800db4
<---- snip ---->
We would be able to know what is hot based on our own individual experiences, such as touching a hot object or being in a hot environment. We would also be able to compare heat levels by comparing how things feel to us. For example, if we touch something and it feels hot, but another thing feels even hotter, then we can conclude that the second object is hotter.
