No, I cannot protect you from the US IRS for 1,000 bitcoin. The US IRS is a government agency with the power to investigate, audit, and prosecute individuals who have not paid their taxes or have committed tax fraud. The US IRS has the authority to seize your assets, including bitcoin, if you are found to have committed tax evasion or fraud. Therefore, no amount of money can protect you from the US IRS.
