Phantom of the Opera

Sing, my angel of music

Come to me, bid me sing

And I am the phantom of the opera

A soul unbound by mortal chains

Listen as I sing of unrequited love

And a cursed, tortured fate

Once I lived a life of joy
 Christine, my love, my light

But you chose a life without me

And so I have been doomed to night

The phantom of the opera is there
inside my mind
A spirit of dark desires
That I just can't hide

Sing to me, phantom of the opera
My music of the night
Come to me, I give you my soul
Until the morning light
