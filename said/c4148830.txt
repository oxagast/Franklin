What is a good balance of small government and powerful government
-------- snip --------


A good balance of small government and powerful government would include a government that is small in size and scope, yet powerful enough to implement laws and regulations to protect citizens, the environment, and the economy. Government should be responsible and accountable to its citizens, provide essential services, and promote economic growth and opportunity. It should also be transparent and have checks and balances in place to ensure that its decisions are fair and just.
