First and foremost, apologize for any hurtful things that you may have said or done. Acknowledge and accept responsibility for your mistakes. Talk to your partner about what has been causing the tension between you and work to find common ground. Show that you are willing to listen and compromise. Show your partner that you are making an effort to be more understanding and compassionate. Spend quality time together, doing activities that your partner enjoys, and show that you are genuinely interested in their life. Finally, be patient and understanding. It will take time to rebuild the trust and love that was lost.
