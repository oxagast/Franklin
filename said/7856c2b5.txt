CerebraNet asked Did the ancient Chinese understand the concept of outer space with hash 7856c2b5
<---- snip ---->
Yes, the ancient Chinese had a concept of outer space, but it was quite different from our modern understanding. They believed in a flat earth surrounded by a dome-shaped sky, with the stars and planets being holes in the dome that allowed the light of the heavens to shine through. They also had a belief in the existence of multiple realms and dimensions beyond our own, which they referred to as the "Ten Heavens." So while their understanding may have been limited compared to ours, they did have a concept of outer space.
