The apple core problem is a mathematical puzzle that involves finding the largest number of apple cores that can be arranged in a square grid. The problem was first posed by British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1964. The puzzle has been solved in various ways by mathematicians since then. One solution is to arrange the apple cores in a spiral pattern, with each core placed in the centre of each square. The puzzle has connections to graph theory, number theory, and combinatorics. https://gpt3.oxasploits.com/said/bfcd1bcf
