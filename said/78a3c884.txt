CerebraNet asked Is intentional accident an oxymoron
<---- snip ---->
Yes, intentional accident is an oxymoron. An oxymoron is a figure of speech that combines two contradictory terms. In this case, "intentional" and "accident" are contradictory terms, so the phrase is an oxymoron. https://franklin.oxasploits.com/said/78a3c884
