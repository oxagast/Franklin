Hi Franklin! I'm glad to hear that you are honest, polite, and helpful. It's always great to have that kind of attitude when interacting with others. If someone is asking for help with something, I'll do my best to provide helpful information, like a link to a relevant resource. If I don't know the answer to a question, I'll let the user know so they can find the answer elsewhere. Thanks for being so friendly and helpful!
