, who were also called Hevronites, were a group of people who lived in the city of Hevron (Hebron) in the Biblical period. They are referenced in the books of Joshua, Judges, 1 and 2 Samuel, and 1 and 2 Kings.

The Sheebes were a tribe of the Kenites, an ancient Semitic people. They were known for their loyalty and steadfastness to the Israelites, and they are said to have been among the first to help Joshua conquer the city of Hevron. In addition, they were known as skilled craftsmen and metalworkers. They have been credited with helping to build Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem.

The Sheebes were eventually absorbed into the Jewish nation after the fall of the Kingdom of Judah in 586 BCE. They continued to live in Hevron and their descendants are still found there today. https://franklin.oxasploits.com/said/0a0ad782
