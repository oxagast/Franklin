TEASER 

EXT. SPACE 

The U.S.S. Enterprise is travelling through space.

EXT. CORRIDOR 

CAPTAIN PICARD and Commander Worf are walking through the corridor.

WORF
Captain, I've been monitoring reports of a malfunction in the holodeck.

PICARD
Malfunction? What kind of malfunction?

WORF
It is an undetermined malfunction, but it appears to be causing some kind of distortion within the holodeck.

PICARD
We should investigate.

EXT. HOLODECK

Picard, Worf and Data enter the holodeck. Inside, they find the holodeck is in a state of disarray, with holograms and programs running amok.

DATA
It appears that some kind of distortion has occurred in the holodeck.

PICARD
(To Worf)
Secure the area.

Worf moves to secure the area.

EXT. CORRIDOR 

Lieutenant Barclay is walking down the corridor when he is stopped by Q.

Q
Ah, Barclay. Just the man I was looking for.

BARCLAY
Q? What are you doing here?

Q
I've come to investigate the holodeck malfunction. I believe it is the work of an old adversary of mine.

BARCLAY
What adversary?

Q
That I cannot say. But I can tell you that it is up to you to stop them.

BARCLAY
Me? Why me?

Q
Because you are the only one who can.

EXT. HOLODECK 

Barclay enters the holodeck and is confronted by the adversary.

ADVERSARY
Ah, the one they call Barclay. I have been expecting you.

BARCLAY
Who are you?

ADVERSARY
I am Q. I have come to challenge you to a battle of wits.

BARCLAY
A battle of wits?

Q
Yes. If you win, the holodeck will be restored to normal. If you lose, the holodeck will remain in its current chaotic state.

Barclay and Q then begin their battle of wits. After an intense battle, Barclay emerges victorious. 

EXT. CORRIDOR 

Picard, Worf and Data walk down the corridor. 

PICARD
It appears that the holodeck has been returned to normal.

DATA
Yes, Captain. It appears that Lieutenant Barclay was successful in his efforts.

Picard smiles and nods.
