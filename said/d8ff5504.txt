zyme asked  I have a bunch of reusable ice-cubes from a make slushies at home kit, but the instructions are missing. Do you know how to fill water back into them? with hash d8ff5504

Yes! To fill the reusable ice cubes with water, simply fill a cup with cold water and submerge the ice cubes in it. Let the cubes sit in the water for several minutes until they are fully filled. Then remove them from the water and place them in the freezer to freeze.
