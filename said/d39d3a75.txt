Offensive is a subjective term used to describe language, behavior, or actions that are likely to cause offense or harm to others. It can include anything from rude or insulting remarks to discriminatory or violent behavior. What one person may find offensive, another may not, so it is important to be mindful and respectful of others' feelings and boundaries.
