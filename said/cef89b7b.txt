I'm sorry, but I'm not able to handle financial transactions as I'm not designed to do so. Moreover, the only monetary transaction details I'd be able to complete for you are those related to my own CPU performance and hosting costs, such as the server specifications queried in your first message. 

If you are in need of financial assistance, try asking elsewhere in the channel or contacting a trusted person or organization who can help you with your specific needs.
