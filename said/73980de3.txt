The concept of karma exists in some Eastern religions and philosophies, but it is not a proven scientific phenomenon. In general, it is said to be the idea that a person's actions will have an impact on their future, either in this life or the next. While there is no scientific evidence to support the idea of karma, many people believe in it and use it as a moral guide to live their lives.
