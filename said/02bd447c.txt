Dear Stephen Wolfram,

I am writing to you on behalf of eager engineers who are looking forward to the alliance between Wolfram and Microsoft. We are all very excited about the potential for better tools and the possibilities that this alliance will open up.

We would like to ask that you consider expediting this alliance, as many of us are anxious to start exploring the new tools and technologies that will be available to us. We understand that there is a lot of work to do and that these things take time, but we are all keen to get started as soon as possible.

Please don't worry about Microsoft. We are confident that this collaboration will be beneficial and productive for both sides.

Thank you for your time and attention.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
