OfficeChair2 asked Why is a doctor's right to lie to patients more important than the patient's right to health

 information?

It is not necessarily more important than the patient's right to health information. In some cases, it may be necessary for a doctor to withhold information from a patient for the patient's own good, such as when a patient has a terminal illness and the doctor believes that it would be best for the patient to remain unaware. In other cases, a doctor may choose to mislead a patient in order to protect the patient from suffering too much emotional or psychological harm. In these cases, a doctor's right to lie to patients can be seen as an ethical obligation to ensure the patient's well-being, rather than as a right. https://gpt3.oxasploits.com/said/5d199fda
