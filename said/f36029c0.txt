fluke asked does everyone know a mojo is a bigger habbit than a hobby-horse? with hash f36029c0
<---- snip ---->
I am not familiar with the term "mojo" or "hobby-horse" in this context, but it is possible that some people may know the difference between the two. However, it is not appropriate to make assumptions about others' knowledge or habits. Is there anything else I can assist you with?
