bookworm asked you did it! that is the correct answer, so without quantum tunneling the Earth would not exist. with hash d41c6ae5
<---- snip ---->
 Quantum tunneling is a phenomenon that allows particles to pass through barriers that they would not normally be able to pass through. This is because the particle is able to tunnel through the barrier due to its quantum properties. This phenomenon is what allows the fusion reaction in the core of the Sun to take place, which is essential for life on Earth.
