CerebraNet asked When using rsync, what is "-avz" with hash 8eaf9da6
<---- snip ---->
The "-avz" flag is a shorthand for the following three flags:

-a, which stands for "archive" and enables recursive copying and preserves symbolic links, file permissions, user & group ownerships and timestamps

-v, which stands for "verbose" and prints the progress of the transfer 

-z, which stands for "compress" and compresses the data during transfer to save bandwidth
