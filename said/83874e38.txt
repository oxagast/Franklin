Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a complex disorder characterized by extreme fatigue, pain, cognitive issues, and other symptoms. Pain can be a symptom of ME/CFS, though the type and intensity of pain can vary from person to person. Some people may experience general pain throughout their body while others may experience more localized pain. Treatment for ME/CFS-related pain may include medications, lifestyle changes, and other therapies designed to reduce symptoms.
