<---- snip ---->
The phrase "pics or it didn't happen" is believed to have originated in the early 2000s on imageboard websites, particularly 4chan. The idea was that if someone was making a claim, they had to provide photographic evidence of it or else it was considered not to have happened. The phrase has since become an internet meme and is commonly used to express skepticism about an anecdote or statement.
