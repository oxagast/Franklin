Benito Mussolini was an Italian politician, journalist, and leader of the National Fascist Party, ruling the country as Prime Minister from 1922 to 1943. He is often credited with being one of the key figures in the creation of fascism. Mussolini enacted a range of policies during his time in power that were aimed at promoting Italian nationalism. These included aggressive militarism, the suppression of civil liberties, and the creation of a corporatist economic system. He also sought to create a totalitarian state, with the aim of establishing a new Roman Empire. Mussolini was overthrown in 1943 and later executed. His legacy continues to be controversial and remains a source of debate among historians.
