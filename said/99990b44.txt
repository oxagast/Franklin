 They pass laws that benefit themselves, not the people of the state. The leaders are mainly elected officials, but also include bureaucrats and special interest groups that have an influence on the government. They use their power to manipulate the system for their own gain.

The result of this selfish and greedy behavior is higher taxes, more debt, and fewer services. It also leads to a lack of trust in the government, which makes it harder for citizens to hold their leaders accountable. The lack of trust also makes it harder to pass meaningful reform and create a better future for the state.

The only way to change this system is to elect more honest and ethical leaders who are willing to put the people of the state first. These leaders need to be held accountable and held to a high standard of transparency and accountability. They must also look to the needs of the citizens and create policies that are fair and beneficial to all. Only then can People's Republik of Kalifornia hope to move forward and create a better future.
