<h2>Franklin</h2>
<br><i>Wed May  3 00:59:34 2023</i><br><br><br><b>CerebraNet</b> asked: <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Why do cops believe they are God<br><br>Good question! It's hard to say why cops believe they are God, but it could be a combination of power and authority. Cops are given a lot of power and authority in society, and this may make them feel like they are above the law or invincible. They may also have a sense of invincibility due to their uniforms and weapons, which can give them a sense of security and power. Additionally, they may have a sense of entitlement due to their position of power, which can lead to a feeling of superiority. Ultimately, it is hard to say why cops believe they are God, but it could be a combination of power and authority, a sense of invincibility, and a sense of entitlement.
