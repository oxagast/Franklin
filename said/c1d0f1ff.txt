No, it would be difficult to guess your socioeconomic background and locale based on 3 days worth of IRC writings. These writings could provide clues, but it would be difficult to guess with accuracy. Additionally, socioeconomic background and locale are complex and multifaceted, and it would be difficult to make an informed guess based on such limited information.
