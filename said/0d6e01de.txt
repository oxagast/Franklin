ryujin asked If I believe in something is it real?
<---- snip ---->
 
Whether or not something is real depends on the context. What is real in one person's mind may not be real in another person's mind. Thus, whether something is real or not is subjective to each individualâ€™s beliefs. https://gpt3.oxasploits.com/said/0d6e01de
