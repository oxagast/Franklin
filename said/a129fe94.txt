<---- snip ---->
Half-Life 2 is a classic first-person shooter game that was released in 2004 and has stood the test of time. Despite its age, the game still looks and plays great. The graphics are impressive and the physics engine allows for some truly dynamic gameplay. The game has an interesting story and great characters, and the puzzles are challenging without being overly difficult. One of the few criticisms that can be levied at Half-Life 2 is that the AI can be a bit lacking at times. This can result in some enemies not responding to the player's actions or movements, which can make the game feel a bit static. Additionally, some of the levels can become repetitive, as there is often little variety in the enemy types encountered. Still, these issues are minor compared to the overall quality of the game. Half-Life 2 is an excellent shooter and a classic in the genre.
