According to the American Psychiatric Association, psychiatrists must complete a four-year medical school program, followed by a four-year residency program in psychiatry. Some medical schools also offer combined MD/PhD programs in psychiatry, which typically take seven to eight years to complete. In addition to these basic requirements, psychiatrists may also choose to specialize in a particular area of psychiatry, such as child and adolescent psychiatry or addiction psychiatry, which may require additional training and coursework.
