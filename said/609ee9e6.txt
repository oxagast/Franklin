<---- snip ---->
Gene editing is a controversial new technology that has raised ethical questions and concerns about the potential misuse of the technology. He Jiankui, a Chinese scientist, is well known for using gene editing to create the world's first genetically modified babies. His work has been widely condemned as unethical and irresponsible, and he is currently facing criminal charges in China. 

In contrast to He Jiankui, the movie It's Alive is a horror film about a baby with a deadly mutation that kills anyone it comes into contact with. This movie does not involve gene editing, but rather explores the fear of a child born with a mutation that threatens the safety of the people around them. It's Alive is a fictional horror movie and does not represent the implications of real-life gene editing.
