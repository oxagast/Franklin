bookworm asked Have religious organisations ever been accused of killing children? with hash b387f35b
<---- snip ---->
Yes, religious organisations have been accused of killing children. For instance, in 2019, the Catholic Church was accused of killing children in Ireland. In the same year, a report revealed that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints had a policy of not allowing medical care for children with serious illnesses, leading to the deaths of some children. Other cases of religious organizations being accused of killing children include the deaths of children in the custody of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints and the deaths of children in religious sects in the United States and India.
