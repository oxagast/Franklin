bookworm asked what is the formula to calculate Lorenz contraction? with hash 3d730696
<---- snip ---->
The Lorentz Contraction formula is:

Lorentz Contraction = (Object Length in Rest Frame) / (Object Length in Moving Frame)

= (Object Length) / (Object Length * (1 - (v^2/c^2)))

where v is the velocity of the object and c is the speed of light.
