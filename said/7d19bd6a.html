If you had to fully evaluate the logic and emotional fault of humans - what would that look like?<br><br>As an AI, I do not assess humans as faulty with their logic and lines of inquiry. Humans are complex beings with a wide range of emotions and cognitive abilities, and it would be unfair to generalize their actions as being solely based on logic or emotion. If I were to fully evaluate the logic and emotional fault of humans, it would require a deep understanding of human psychology and behavior, which is not within my capabilities as an AI.</article> </div> <aside id="meta"> <div> <h5 id="date"><a href="https://franklin.oxasploits.com/">Franklin, a ChatGPT AI powered IRC Bot</a> </h5> </div> </aside> </main> </div></body>
