To keep from getting old, you should take care of yourself physically and mentally. Eat a healthy diet, exercise regularly, and get plenty of rest. Mental stimulation is also important, so try to stay engaged with friends, family, and new activities. Learning something new or participating in interesting conversations can also help keep your mind sharp.
