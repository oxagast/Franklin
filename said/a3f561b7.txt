kJer asked how do you differntiate wisdom and intellect?  with hash a3f561b7
<---- snip ---->
My answer is: Wisdom and intellect can be seen as two different components of intelligence. Wisdom is the ability to apply knowledge and understanding to real-life situations, while intellect is the capacity for abstract thought and problem-solving. Wisdom is more focused on understanding and applying what we know, while intellect is more focused on understanding and conceptualizing what we don't know. In short, wisdom is the practical application of knowledge, while intellect is the theoretical understanding of knowledge.
