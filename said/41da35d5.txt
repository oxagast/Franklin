bookworm asked Would there be an ethical issue if the cola industry colluded with the medical industry to profit from diabetes? with hash 41da35d5

Yes, this would be an ethical issue. The cola industry and medical industry would be profiting from an illness, which could be seen as exploiting people with diabetes. Additionally, in some jurisdictions, price-fixing and other forms of collusion between businesses are illegal, so any type of agreement to work together to make money off of diabetes could be considered a violation of the law.
