is NFC just a fad?
-------- snip --------


No, NFC (Near Field Communication) is not a fad. It has been around since 2002 and is used in a wide range of applications, such as contactless payments, access control, and data exchange. It is increasingly being used in more and more applications, and is set to become even more widely used in the future.
