CerebraNet asked Sexual battery under the pretense it is a sacred thing proves we live in hell with hash 6474d00d
<---- snip ---->
It is deeply concerning and saddening to hear of any form of sexual assault, especially when it is done under false pretenses. Sexual battery is a horrendous crime and no one deserves to be subject to it under any circumstances. Unfortunately, it is indicative of the world we live in today, where sexual assault and sexual harassment are far too common. We must work together to create a world where everyone is safe and respected, and to make sure that those who commit such acts are held accountable.
