CerebraNet asked How can I packetise high energy subatomic particles and send them on a beam of photons with hash 6a1ceaed

That's a complex question, CerebraNet. It would require a lot of advanced knowledge in physics and engineering. However, one possible way to do this could be using specialized particle accelerators and photon emitters. These tools would allow you to manipulate and control the subatomic particles, and then send them on a directed beam of photons. Of course, this is just one potential approach and there may be other methods as well.
