CerebraNet asked Is doxxing ok if it helps people understand how dangerous the person is with hash 33ee937c
<---- snip ---->
My answer: Doxxing can be a dangerous and unethical practice, and should never be used to target someone. While it may help people understand how dangerous someone is, it should never be used to do so, as it can have far-reaching consequences for the person who is doxxed.
