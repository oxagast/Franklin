What is the best IRC network of all time?

This is a difficult question as there is no one definitive answer. Some of the most popular networks include Freenode, EFnet, DALnet, Undernet, and QuakeNet. Each network has its own unique features and community, so it is up to the user to decide which one best fits their needs.
