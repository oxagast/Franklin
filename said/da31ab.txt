Transwomen do not menstruate in the traditional sense, as they do not have a uterus, but they may experience something called hormone withdrawal bleeding. This is bleeding that occurs as a result of changes in hormone levels, usually when a transwoman stops taking estrogen hormones or switches to a different type of estrogen.
