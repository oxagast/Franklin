code asked write a shell script to display operating system, ram utilization, cpu utilization, and uptime in a single line of output with hash 2a7a4b33
<---- snip ---->
Sure, here's the one-liner shell script you're looking for: `echo OS: $(uname -a); RAM: $(free -m | awk '/^Mem/{print $3"MB"}'); CPU: $(top -bn1 | awk '/^Cpu/{print $2"%"}'); UPTIME: $(uptime | awk -F'( |,|:)+' '{if ($7=="min") m=$6; else {if ($7~/^day/) {d=$6;h=$8;m=$9} else {h=$6;m=$7}}} {print d+0,"days,",h+0,"hours,",m+0,"minutes"}')`
