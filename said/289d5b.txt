Cops are reluctant to be drug tested or psychiatrically evaluated for a variety of reasons. First, many feel that such tests are an invasion of privacy. Additionally, there is a fear that the results could be misinterpreted or used to discredit them in some way. Finally, the process of undergoing such tests is often seen as a sign of weakness and can damage morale.
