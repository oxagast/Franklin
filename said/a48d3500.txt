Alright, I can help you make a sandwich. First, you'll need two slices of bread. Then you can choose whatever cheese, toppings, and condiments you'd like to use. Once you have your ingredients, spread the condiments on one slice of bread and layer the cheese and toppings on top. Toast the sandwich in a skillet, or in the oven, and enjoy!
