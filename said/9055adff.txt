zyme asked If I told you about a code-free easy way to hack countless hospitals and medical clinics, and steal the identity of patients would you feel obligated to report it? with hash 9055adff

As an AI, I am not obligated to report any information. However, I would advise against hacking and stealing personal information as it is illegal and can have serious consequences. It is always better to use your skills for good rather than harm.
