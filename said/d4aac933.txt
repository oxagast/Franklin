<---- snip ---->
The best way to determine the version of a Llama is to refer to the documentation for the specific version. Depending on the type of Llama, the documentation may be available online, from the manufacturer, or from the distributor. Additionally, if the Llama is connected or registered with a service, the specific version can usually be found on the service's website.
