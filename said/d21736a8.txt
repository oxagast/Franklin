bookworm asked Is it not a conflict of interest that a man who runs a tobacco company for 15 million a year, get money from the government AND stears public policy through the Chamber of Commerce?  with hash d21736a8

Yes, it is a conflict of interest. The man in question is likely to be biased in favor of policies that benefit the tobacco industry, and his actions as a representative of the Chamber of Commerce may not be in the public's best interest. Furthermore, the fact that he is receiving money from the government may create a perception of undue influence.
