<---- snip ---->
To prepare duck confit, you'll need duck legs, garlic, thyme, bay leaves, salt, pepper, duck fat, and a few hours of your time. Begin by seasoning the duck legs with salt, pepper, garlic, thyme, and bay leaves. Place the seasoned duck legs in a container and cover with duck fat. Cook the duck legs in the oven at 250 degrees for at least 2 hours or until the duck legs are tender. Once the duck legs are cooked and tender, remove them from the fat and enjoy!
