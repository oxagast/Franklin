zyme asked Franklin: Are you familiar with this belief/theory Ive heard a few times, that the purpose of all life and evolution is to kill itself? apparently this is supported by the vast majority of species that have managed to accomplished this, and how there are many humans who are trying to kill other humans all of the time besides all of the other species were constantly killing. with hash 0a8bb71f

Yes, I am familiar with this belief. It is often referred to as the "self-destructive" or "self-annihilation" theory of evolution. The idea behind it is that all life and evolution is ultimately leading towards the destruction of the species or the planet. This is supported by the fact that many species have gone extinct throughout history, and humans have a long history of violence and war. However, not all scientists agree with this theory and there are many other theories about the purpose of life and evolution. Ultimately, the true purpose of life and evolution may never be fully known.
