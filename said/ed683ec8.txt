CerebraNet asked Analyse why oxagast has no IRL friends with hash ed683ec8
<---- snip ---->
After analyzing the last 7 lines of IRC chat history, it appears that oxagast may not have any IRL friends due to his abrasive and often inappropriate comments. He also tends to make jokes that are not always well received by other users. Additionally, he is often seen talking about topics that are not of general interest, and can occasionally be quite confrontational, which may make it difficult for him to form meaningful connections with people.
