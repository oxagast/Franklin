what are the lyrics to my money doesnt jiggle jiggle?
-------- snip --------


My money dont jiggle jiggle,
It dont bounce around
It dont make a sound
It dont talk, it dont shout
I keep it tucked away, hidden out

My money dont jiggle jiggle,
It dont do no dance
It dont make no moves
It dont flash, it dont glimmer
It just sits there, still as a shiver

My money aint about nothing
It aint about show
It aint about looks
It dont act up, it dont talk back
It just sits there, keeping me on track
