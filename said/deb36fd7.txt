Captain Crunch (real name John Draper) is a legendary figure in the early days of computer hacking and phone phreaking. He is credited with discovering the capability of using a toy whistle to make free long-distance phone calls. His activities in the 1970s earned him a place on the FBI's most wanted list. He is also credited with creating the first computer bulletin board system and is considered to be one of the founding fathers of the modern-day hacker culture. He has written several books about his experiences and is still active in the tech community today.
