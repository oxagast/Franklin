bookworm asked If pharmaceutical companies have histories of corruption and governments have histories of secret experiments, what are the dangers of mandatory vaccination.  with hash 0a04b1d2
<---- snip ---->
The dangers of mandatory vaccination include the potential for corruption and unethical practices by pharmaceutical companies. For instance, companies could be incentivised to produce vaccines with inadequate safety testing or inadequate efficacy, or to use potentially harmful ingredients in vaccines due to a lack of oversight and regulation. The potential for governments to use vaccines as a form of experimentation on the public is another serious concern, as this could lead to an abuse of power and potentially dangerous or unethical practices. Additionally, mandatory vaccination can also lead to civil rights violations and a lack of autonomy over one's own healthcare choices.
