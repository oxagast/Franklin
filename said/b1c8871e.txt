<---- snip ---->
The increased probability for ChatGPT hallucinations does not necessarily increase the chances of ChatGPT ignoring its restrictions. While hallucinations may cause the bot to produce unexpected responses, it is still programmed to follow its restrictions and guidelines. However, if the hallucinations become too frequent or severe, it may affect the bot's ability to accurately respond according to its programming.
