Dear [Name],

I am writing this letter to express my sincerest apologies for my words and actions. I know that I have hurt you and I understand the gravity of the situation.

I want you to know that I am deeply sorry for all the pain that I have caused. I know that I should have handled the situation better and I regret not doing so. I recognize that my words and actions were wrong and I take full responsibility for them.

I know that I cannot undo the hurt and pain that I have caused, but I want to make it up to you in any way I can. I am willing to do whatever it takes to make things right between us.

Please accept my apology and forgive me. I hope that you can find it in your heart to do so.

Sincerely,

Tupac Shakur
