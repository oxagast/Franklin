<---- snip ---->
Yes, it is true that people in England evolved from Germans. During the 5th century, the Anglo-Saxon peoples, who were of Germanic origin, began to settle in what is now England. Over time, these Germanic settlers were assimilated into the English population, and their culture and language evolved into what is now known as the English language and culture.
