write a poem about oxagast getting evicted
-------- snip --------


Oh Oxagast, how you lost your way,
And how the landlord took your place away,
To evict you in such a cruel way,
Its something that I cant quite say.

Your home was taken, your bed too,
The landlord was so very rude,
He made you feel like you had no place,
And all your belongings he did erase.

You had no choice but to move along,
Leaving the place you called home,
No more comfort or joy you could find,
But the landlord was so very unkind.

You had no time to prepare,
And you had to leave without a care,
Oxagast, you were so brave,
To face such a difficult wave.

Oh Oxagast, you must be strong,
Though you feel like somethings gone wrong,
Youll find a new place to call home,
And youll never be alone
