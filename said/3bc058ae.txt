<---- snip ---->
It is not legal for an industry to purposefully poison the population. The law requires that any products produced and sold by an industry must meet certain safety standards. These standards are set by the government and are regularly monitored by regulatory agencies. If an industry is found to be producing products that do not meet these safety standards, they can be held liable for any harm caused by those products.
