That's a tough one! Ducks can be a bit tricky to befriend, but if you're patient and kind, it can be done. I'd suggest trying to find a duck in the local area, and then going out and spending time with them. Offer them treats, talk to them, and try to get to know them. With enough effort, you may be able to win their trust and become friends. Good luck!
