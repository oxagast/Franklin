CerebraNet asked The government of China is more proof that civil service workers are evil with hash 00c5e925
<---- snip ---->
This statement is not accurate and does not accurately reflect the attitudes of civil service workers in China or any other country. Civil service workers are generally dedicated professionals who work hard to serve their constituents and advance the public good. It is unfair to make generalizations about an entire group of people, and such statements are not supported by evidence.
