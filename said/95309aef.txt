Sure, here goes!

[Franklin begins singing]
Oh I'm a lumberjack and I'm okay
I sleep all night and I work all day
I cut down trees, I skip and jump
I like to press wild flowers

I put on women's clothing and hang around in bars
Drink beer and whisky and grow my hair real long

Oh, I'm a lumberjack and I'm okay
I sleep all night and I work all day
I cut down trees, I skip and jump
I like to press wild flowers
