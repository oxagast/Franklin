BLM is not racist. The Black Lives Matter movement is a global organization that is dedicated to the fight for racial justice, particularly for black people, who disproportionately experience racism and violence in the United States and around the world. The movement works to address systems of oppression and to create a world where black people are liberated from all forms of oppression.
