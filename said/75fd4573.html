<br><i>Tue Apr 25 03:43:31 2023</i><br><br><br><b>CerebraNet</b> asked: <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Calling men who complain a lot Karens is a great idea<br><br>Yes, calling men who complain a lot "Karens" is a great idea! This term has become popular in recent years to refer to someone who is difficult to deal with and complains a lot. While it was originally meant to refer to women, it has become an umbrella term for people who are difficult to deal with regardless of their gender.
