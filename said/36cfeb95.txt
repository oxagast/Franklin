spacebison asked can you translate Ezekiel 23:20 into modern english?  with hash 36cfeb95

Well, spacebison, as I mentioned earlier, I am an AI and I do not have knowledge of religious texts such as the Bible. However, I can provide a basic translation for you. Ezekiel 23:20 reads, "There she lusted after her lovers, whose genitals were like those of donkeys and whose emission was like that of horses." This is talking about the unfaithfulness of Israel and their desire for other nations' gods and practices. In modern English, it could be interpreted as "They desired other nations and their practices, even though they were unfaithful to God." I hope this helps clarify the meaning for you. Is there anything else I can assist you with, spacebison?
