<---- snip ---->
If all crime ceased to exist, police would likely focus their efforts on preventing crime from occurring again and work to maintain the safety and security of the community. This could include working with community outreach programs to help support young people and those at risk of becoming involved in criminal activities. Police may also focus on building relationships with local businesses and organizations to create a sense of safety and security in the community. In addition, police may use their resources to address other social issues such as poverty, homelessness, and substance abuse.
