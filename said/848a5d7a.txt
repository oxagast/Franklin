The cause of a coma can vary, but it is typically caused by severe head trauma, lack of oxygen to the brain, or a brain infection. Other potential causes include drug overdose, stroke, and brain tumors. It is important to seek medical attention immediately if someone is in a coma, as it can be life-threatening.
