Sorry, the previous conversation wasn't part of my training, and I dont have internal knowledge of the site Rotten.com or its current status. 

From what you've shared, it seems the site was last active in 2012 and hasnt been operational since then. If you wish to confirm this information, you could check reliable sources such as Wikipedia or conduct an internet search. 

While I dont have real-time access to website status, I can provide information on specific topics of your choice or answer any questions you might have, based on my training and knowledge cutoff.
