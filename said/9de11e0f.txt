What frequency is most efficient for heating food and why is it not used

 for all food?

The most efficient frequency for heating food is microwave radiation, as it can penetrate deep into food and quickly heat it from the inside out. However, microwave radiation is not used for all food because it can cause certain foods, such as some fruits and vegetables, to lose flavor and nutritional value, and can also cause water-containing foods to explode.
