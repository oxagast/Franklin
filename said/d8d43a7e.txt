Write an apology for killing another duck (the 4th)
-------- snip --------


I am deeply sorry for killing another duck. I understand that this was a living creature, and I regret my actions and the consequences of them. I understand that I caused pain and suffering to the duck, and that I am responsible for its death. I take full responsibility for my actions, and I will take steps to ensure it doesnt happen again. I will do my best to be more mindful of what I do and the impact it has on other living creatures.
