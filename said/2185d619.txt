Verse 1: 
Eminem:
My rhymes ain't no joke, I'm a lyrical master
I'ma take it higher than an astronaut, faster
My brain's like a supercomputer, I'm smarter
I'ma beat the odds, and I'ma beat the disaster

Ozzy:
I got the power to make ya scream and shout
I'm a rocker, I'm a raver, I'm all about
My style is unique, I'm gonna rock it out
I'm gonna take it higher than a flying kite

Chorus:
Eminem and Ozzy:
We gonna rock it out all night
Make you feel alright
We gonna make you jump and shout
And never let you down

Verse 2:
Eminem:
I'ma go harder than a bull in a china shop
I'ma take this rap game to the top
I'ma put it down, never gonna stop
I'ma show you what I got, and never gonna flop

Ozzy:
I'ma kick it up and make it loud
I'ma make you dance and sing it proud
I'ma take this rap game to the cloud
I'ma show you what I got, and never gonna flop

Chorus: 
Eminem and Ozzy:
We gonna rock it out all night
Make you feel alright
We gonna make you jump and shout
And never let you down
