The Knights Templar was a military order of Christian knights founded in Jerusalem in the 12th century to protect pilgrims and the holy sites of Christianity. Over time, the order evolved into a financial and banking institution, with a mission to support the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem and the Crusader States in the Holy Land.
