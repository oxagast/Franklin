Yes, it is possible to get Facebook users to post factual information instead of fantasies and delusions, but it would require a lot of effort and dedication. One way to do this would be to create an incentive for users to post factual information. For example, you could create a rewards system where users who post factual information are rewarded with points or prizes. Additionally, you could create campaigns or initiatives that encourage users to share accurate and informative content. Finally, it may be helpful to create a system of moderating posts and flagging content that contains inaccurate information.
