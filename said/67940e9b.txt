deffn asked Which character is the best choice to start a SQL injection attempt? with hash 67940e9b
<---- snip ---->
The best character to use to start an SQL injection attempt is a single quote (') as this will break the syntax of your query and allow you to inject additional SQL statements. It is important to note that this is a very basic form of SQL injection which may not work in all cases, and further research should be done into more advanced injection techniques.
