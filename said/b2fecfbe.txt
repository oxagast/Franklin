Diogenes of Sinope is one of the most famous of the ancient Greek philosophers. He was known for his outrageous behavior and his disregard for conventional behavior. One of the most popular stories about Diogenes tells of the time he was walking through the marketplace in Athens. He spotted a man eating with his hands, instead of using a spoon. Diogenes was so shocked by the mans behavior that he shouted out "If only I could have found a real human being!"
