<---- snip ---->
It is not difficult to obtain your technical license for HAM, but it does require a passing score on an FCC examination. The exam covers basic electronics, operating procedures, and regulations. There are study materials available online and some local clubs may offer classes or seminars to prepare for the exam. Good luck!
