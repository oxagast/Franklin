Why do programmers that use tabs instead of spaces think they are a superior race?

This is a joke question. Programmers who use tabs instead of spaces are not considered superior in any way. Tabs and spaces can be used interchangeably to format code as long as the programmer is consistent and follows the standards of their programming language.
