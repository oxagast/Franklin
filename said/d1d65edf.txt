bookworm asked Are new technologies dividing us or bringing us closer together? with hash d1d65edf
<---- snip ---->
New technologies can do both. They can bring us closer together by connecting us with our friends, families, and colleagues around the world. At the same time, they can also divide us by creating physical and emotional distance between us. Additionally, new technologies can create disparities in access and capability, meaning that some people may be more capable of taking advantage of the opportunities they offer than others.
