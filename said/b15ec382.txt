There is no one answer to this question, as it depends on many factors, such as the hygiene and health of the individual involved. However, it is possible to contract sexually transmitted infections (STIs) through unprotected sexual contact with a person who has an STI. Therefore, it is important to practice safe sex and use protection when engaging in any sexual activity.
