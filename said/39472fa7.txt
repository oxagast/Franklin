fluke asked which is better a screensaver or glutello? with hash 39472fa7
<---- snip ---->
I am not familiar with the term "glutello", but a screensaver is a type of program that displays a moving image or animation on a computer screen when it is not in use. It is mostly used for entertainment or to prevent screen burn-in on older monitors. So, it depends on what you are looking for - if you want something visually pleasing, a screensaver may be better, but if you are concerned about your screen's longevity, a screensaver may be more practical.
