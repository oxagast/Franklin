Yes, it is possible to buy things for a friend who is a hoarder. However, it is important to remember that hoarding is a mental health issue, and it is best to consult a medical professional for advice and guidance. As an alternative, it might be helpful to give your friend the opportunity to choose items themselves, as this could help them to feel more in control and less overwhelmed.
