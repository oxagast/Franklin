It is impossible to definitively say that no cop has ever executed a dead body for resisting arrest, as it is highly unlikely that this could be proven without a thorough investigation. However, such a serious infraction of police protocol would likely result in the cop being arrested, charged, and/or fired, so it is extremely unlikely that any police officer would do something so extreme. https://franklin.oxasploits.com/said/8a3009b4
