Why couldnt I find any strangers online to kidnap me as a kid?

Kidnapping is a serious crime and it is illegal, so it is highly unlikely that any strangers would offer to kidnap you online. Additionally, most reputable websites have policies in place that prevent people from making offers like this, so it would be difficult to find someone willing to kidnap you online.
