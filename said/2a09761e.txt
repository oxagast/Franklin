The use of nuclear weapons on a global scale would have catastrophic and devastating consequences. Not only would it kill millions of people, but the environmental damage caused by the radiation and fallout would be long lasting, with effects that could last for generations. The economic and political implications of a global thermonuclear war would be far-reaching and would have the potential to cause a global recession and destabilize governments. Therefore, the use of nuclear weapons must be avoided at all costs.
