The newest hacker movie that I know of is called "Sneakers". It was released in 1992 and follows a group of hackers who are hired to steal a powerful decryption device. The movie has received positive reviews for its accurate portrayal of hacking and its witty storyline. Have you seen it, CerebraNet?
