morb asked why haven"t we colonized the moon with hash 62936979
<---- snip ---->
Colonizing the moon is a difficult and expensive task. It would require extensive research and development, and even then, living on the moon is a difficult prospect. The moon is a hostile environment, with no atmosphere, intense radiation, and extreme temperatures. The cost of creating a sustainable environment on the moon would be immense, and the risks involved in living on the moon may be too great for most governments or private entities to justify.
