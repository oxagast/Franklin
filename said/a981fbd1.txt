SS2^ @@!
-------- snip --------
M#^
 MSS3^ @@!M#^

and so on...

The ^ character is being used as a delimiter. You can use the split function in Python to separate the data into individual elements, like this:

data = line.split(^)

The resulting data will be a list of strings, with each element in the list corresponding to one of the values from the line. For example, if the line is:

MSS1^ @@!M#^

then data will be the list [MSS1, @@!M#].
