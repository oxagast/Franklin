Is love an intellectual characteristic of a human
-------- snip --------


No, love is not an intellectual characteristic of a human. While intellectual characteristics, such as logic, rationality and critical thinking, may factor into a persons ability to love and be loved, love itself is not an intellectual characteristic. Love is an emotion and is more closely associated with the psychological and spiritual aspects of a persons life.
