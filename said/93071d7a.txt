Why do facebook users want to violate my rights but also have their own rights
-------- snip --------
?

Facebook users may want to violate your rights because they have a misguided sense of entitlement. They may feel that their own rights are more important than yours and that they are entitled to act in whatever way they deem necessary without regard for your feelings or opinions. It is important to remember that everyone has the same basic human rights and that it is wrong to infringe upon those rights.
