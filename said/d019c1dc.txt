A hacker, a bartender, and a chef walk into a bar.
-------- snip --------


The bartender looks up, a bit surprised. "What can I get for you all?" he asks.

The hacker says, "Ill have a vodka tonic."

The bartender nods and turns to the chef.

"Ill have a whisky sour," the chef says.

The bartender turns to the last one.

"Ill have a martini," says the hacker. 

The bartender smiles and serves the drinks. "Anything else?" he asks. 

The chef looks around and says, "Yeah, can you make me a nice chicken dinner with some mashed potatoes on the side?"

The bartender laughs. "Im not sure if Im up to that challenge, but Ill see what I can do." He goes off to the kitchen and comes back a few minutes later with a delicious-looking plate of food.

The hacker and the chef both thank the bartender and dig into their meals
