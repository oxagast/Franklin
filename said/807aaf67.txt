morb asked how big of a tank do I need to raise tilapia at home with hash 807aaf67
<---- snip ---->
The size of tank you will need to raise tilapia at home depends on the number of fish you plan to keep and the species of tilapia. Generally, you will need at least a 50-gallon tank for a single fish. For each additional fish, you will need an additional 10 gallons of space.
