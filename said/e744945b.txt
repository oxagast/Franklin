<---- snip ---->
A foot crab is a type of crab that has adapted to walking on land. Unlike most crabs, which primarily live in the water, foot crabs have developed legs that are strong enough to support their weight on land. They are typically found in coastal areas and can range in size from a few inches to several feet. Foot crabs are known for their ability to scurry across the ground quickly and their strong claws, which they use to catch prey and defend themselves. They are also popular in some areas as a delicacy for seafood lovers.
