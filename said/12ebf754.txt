Russia has a secret underground network of bunkers, tunnels, and military bases that are designed to protect the government in the event of a nuclear attack. The precise locations of these facilities are kept secret to prevent them from being targeted by enemy forces. https://gpt3.oxasploits.com/said/12ebf754
