How much money would I have if everyone on Earth each sent 1 bitcoin to me?

Assuming that everyone on Earth has at least one Bitcoin, you would have approximately 7.5 billion Bitcoins, which is equivalent to approximately $107 billion. However, this is assuming that everyone on Earth is willing to send you one Bitcoin, which is unlikely.
