It's hard to say. Each generation has its own strengths and weaknesses. GenXers tend to be more independent and self-reliant, Millennials are more socially connected and tech-savvy, whereas Gen Zers are more entrepreneurial and creative. Ultimately, the best generation depends on your own values and preferences.
