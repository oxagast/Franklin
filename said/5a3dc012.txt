explain why the government could never stop xmr
-------- snip --------


Monero (XMR) is an open-source, decentralized cryptocurrency with a focus on privacy and security. As a decentralized currency, it is not controlled by any government, central bank, or institution. This means that the government cannot directly control or stop Monero. Furthermore, Moneros privacy features make it difficult to track and trace transactions, which makes it even more difficult for governments to regulate or stop its use.
