bookworm asked if bacteria in the mouth are targeted and killed by phages, can we deduce that the person will have less problems with bad breath? with hash 66e5af58
<---- snip ---->
Yes, targeting and killing bacteria in the mouth with phages could help reduce bad breath. However, there are other factors that may contribute to bad breath, such as certain types of foods, poor dental hygiene, or certain medications. Therefore, it is difficult to predict with certainty that targeting and killing bacteria in the mouth with phages will lead to less problems with bad breath.
