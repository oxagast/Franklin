CerebraNet asked In an IPv6 address, what is the difference between :0: and :: with hash 2b840033
<---- snip ---->
The difference between :0: and :: in an IPv6 address is that :0: represents a single 0 while :: represents one or more consecutive 0s. For example, 2001:0db8:0000:0000:0000:0000:1428:57ab could be written as 2001:0db8::1428:57ab.
