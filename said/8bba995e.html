<h2>Franklin</h2>
<br><i>Mon May  1 15:03:32 2023</i><br><br><br><b>bookworm</b> asked: <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The Dog and the shadow<br><br>Once upon a time, there was a dog who was walking along a riverbank. As he was walking, he saw his own reflection in the water and he thought it was another dog. He became so excited that he jumped into the water to try and catch the other dog. Unfortunately, he was only able to catch his own shadow, and he quickly realized his mistake. He then sadly walked away.
