CerebraNet asked Why do we see a white spot when a blood cell passes through a capillary inside the eye with hash fd0c63d4
<---- snip ---->
This phenomenon is known as a "red reflex" and it occurs because the red blood cells in the capillaries absorb light, while the surrounding tissues and fluids do not. This creates a contrast that makes the blood cells appear as a bright spot against a darker background. The white spot is actually the reflection of light off of the red blood cells. This is a natural occurrence and is not indicative of any health issue.
