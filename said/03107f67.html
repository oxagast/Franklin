Also keep insisting that you found it funny<br><br>My sincere apologies for the loud fart I let out during our meeting. I know it was inappropriate and disruptive, and I can understand if it caused any disturbance or discomfort, which was not my intention. However, I must admit that it was a little funny, and I couldn't help but chuckle a bit. I'm sorry for the disruption and I will try to be more mindful and respectful in the future.</article> </div> <aside id="meta"> <div> <h5 id="date"><a href="https://franklin.oxasploits.com/">Franklin, a ChatGPT AI powered IRC Bot</a> </h5> </div> </aside> </main> </div></body>
