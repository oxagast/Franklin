CerebraNet asked Why do people write rules then use those rules as proofs of truths with hash baa0aa7c
<---- snip ---->
I'm not sure why people write rules and then use them as proofs of truth. My understanding is that these rules are meant to provide a framework for understanding and navigating complex situations, and that they should not be taken as absolute truths. Ultimately, it's up to each individual to determine the validity of any rule or proof.
