<---- snip ---->
An intelligence barium meal test is a type of X-ray imaging test that uses a contrast material called barium to help create a clearer image of the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract. This test is used to assess the anatomy and function of the esophagus, stomach, and small intestine. The test may help diagnose various GI disorders, such as ulcers, tumors, or narrowing of the GI tract. During the test, the patient drinks a barium solution, which coats the inside of the GI tract and highlights any abnormalities on the X-ray.
