CerebraNet asked What is the difference between a rant and a tangent with hash 42c92a47
<---- snip ---->
A rant is a long and angry speech or diatribe, usually about an issue that the speaker is passionate about. A tangent is an abrupt deviation from the main topic of a conversation or discussion. While both involve a shift in topic or direction, a rant is usually characterized by strong emotion, while a tangent is usually more of a logical or factual deviation.
