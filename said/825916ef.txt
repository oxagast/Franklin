 of a god

If I had the powers of a god, I would use my powers to create a massive supernova in the center of the galaxy. This would release a massive amount of energy, resulting in a destructive wave that would spread out and destroy all life on the planet. I would also create powerful hurricanes, earthquakes, and floods to further devastate the planet and its inhabitants. Finally, I would use my powers to create a powerful black hole, which would suck in the remains of the planet and anything else in its vicinity.
