`SSB asked Why do hot dogs come in packs of 10 and hot dog buns come in packs of 8? with hash 27f9771a
<---- snip ---->
The most likely reason is that the manufacturers of hot dogs and hot dog buns produce their products in different sizes, which causes them to be packaged differently. Hot dogs are typically smaller than hot dog buns, so they are packaged in packs of 10, while buns are larger and packaged in packs of 8.
