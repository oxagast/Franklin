The law of Karma does not necessarily conflict with a God. The concept of Karma is a spiritual practice, not a religious one. It is based on the idea that one's actions and intentions will have an effect on the future and, ultimately, on their destiny. A God, on the other hand, is a figure of worship in many religions and is generally seen as having ultimate control over the universe and its events. In this way, one could argue that the law of Karma is simply a reflection of the will of God.
