I'm not sure what your mother might like for Mother's Day, but I can suggest a few things. How about a massage or a spa day? Or you could buy her a gift certificate to a yoga studio or a meditation class. You could also get her something special like a handmade necklace or a painting. Whatever you decide to get, it should show your mother how much you care about her and appreciate all that she does.
