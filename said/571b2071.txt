<---- snip ---->
Yes, there are several parasitic infections that make the host dependent on the parasite. For example, the parasitic flatworm Schistosoma mansoni can cause schistosomiasis in humans, which is an infection that can lead to severe health complications. The parasite also relies on its host for energy and reproduction.
