Tacos have been enjoyed in Mexico since the pre-Hispanic era, with the first reference to the taco appearing in a Mexican dictionary in the 18th century. The original tacos consisted of a small piece of grilled or fried corn tortilla filled with various ingredients such as shredded meats, beans, vegetables, and seasonings.

The modern taco is a combination of indigenous Mexican and Spanish foods, with a variety of fillings and toppings. In the early 20th century, tacos filled with beef, cheese, and lettuce began to appear in Mexican restaurants in the United States. By the mid-20th century, tacos had become a popular street food in Mexico and the United States. In the 1980s, tacos filled with a variety of ingredients, including grilled vegetables, fish, and seafood, began to appear.

Today, tacos are enjoyed around the world and come in a variety of styles and sizes, with fillings ranging from traditional Mexican ingredients to international flavors. From soft tacos to hard-shell tacos, tacos have become one of the most popular Mexican dishes in the world.
