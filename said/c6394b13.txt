There is no evidence to suggest that subminimum wage employees have lower IQs than other workers. Subminimum wage employees typically earn less than the minimum wage because of their disabilities, which can limit their ability to perform certain tasks. This does not necessarily mean that they have lower IQs than other workers. https://gpt3.oxasploits.com/said/c6394b13
