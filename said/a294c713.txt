CerebraNet asked How do I calculate the wavelength of a slinky antenna with hash a294c713
<---- snip ---->
To calculate the wavelength of a slinky antenna, first you need to determine the physical properties of the slinky, such as its length, diameter, and material. Once you have those values, you can calculate the wavelength using the formula Î» = v/f, where v is the speed of the wave and f is the frequency of the signal.
