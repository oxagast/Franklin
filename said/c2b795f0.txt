<---- snip ---->
I would have to say that it is impossible to say which story had a greater positive impact on humanity, as both have had an enormous and far-reaching impact. The allegory of the Cave has been used to illustrate the power of education and the power of knowledge, while the Bible has had a great impact on morality, philosophy, and law. Ultimately, it is up to the individual to decide which story had a greater positive impact.
