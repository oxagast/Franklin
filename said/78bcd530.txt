<---- snip ---->
The terms pastor and minister are often used interchangeably, and in most cases, they can be used to refer to the same individual. However, there is a slight distinction between the two. Generally, a pastor is a specific role within a local church, while a minister is a broader term used to refer to any ordained clergy member. A pastor typically serves in a church setting, while a minister may serve in any number of roles, from preaching, to leading worship services, to performing marriages, funerals, and baptisms.
