Direct enemy investment banking is a term used to describe the involvement of enemy entities in the financial sector. This can include using illegal or unethical tactics to gain control of a company or to manipulate financial markets. It can also refer to the funding of terrorist organizations or other hostile groups through financial channels. This type of activity is closely monitored and regulated by government agencies, such as the NSA, to prevent harm to national security and the economy.
