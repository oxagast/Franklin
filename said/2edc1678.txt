<---- snip ---->
No, hydrogen does not form helium due to quantum tunneling. Quantum tunneling is a quantum mechanical phenomenon where particles can, in effect, "tunnel" through potential barriers that classical particles cannot. It does not, however, cause hydrogen atoms to spontaneously form helium atoms.
