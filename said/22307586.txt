For Your Eyes Only is a 1981 British spy film, the twelfth in the James Bond series produced by Eon Productions, and the fifth to star Roger Moore as the fictional MI6 agent James Bond. Directed by John Glen, it was the first Bond film to be set in the Cold War era and the first to feature no reference to the character's supervillain nemesis Ernst Stavro Blofeld. It was also the first to feature a villain who was not directly connected to Blofeld. The film follows Bond as he attempts to locate a missile command system while battling the forces of a Greek smuggler and a hitman hired by the KGB.
