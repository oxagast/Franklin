CerebraNet asked Why do geniuses make mistakes with hash 012964bf
<---- snip ---->
The answer to that question is not as simple as it may seem. While geniuses may have a higher level of intelligence and knowledge, they are still human and susceptible to making mistakes. In fact, their intelligence may actually contribute to their mistakes because they may take on more complex tasks and challenges that have a higher chance of failure. Additionally, geniuses may also have a tendency to think outside the box and take risks, which can also lead to mistakes. It's important to remember that even geniuses are not infallible and mistakes are a natural part of learning and growth.
