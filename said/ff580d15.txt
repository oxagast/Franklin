xibalba asked explain network service chaining to me like im a plebian with hash ff580d15
<---- snip ---->
Network service chaining is a method of connecting multiple network services in a specific sequence to create a chain of services. It allows for more efficient routing and management of network traffic. Think of it like a chain of restaurants where each restaurant provides a different service, and the customer moves from one to the next in a specific order to get their desired outcome. Does that make sense?
