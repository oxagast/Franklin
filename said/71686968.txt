<---- snip ---->
Antiviral medicines work by interfering with the reproduction of viruses in the body. They can prevent viruses from replicating, stop them from entering cells, or stop them from releasing their genetic material. They can also interfere with the enzymes that viruses use to replicate and assemble new viruses.
