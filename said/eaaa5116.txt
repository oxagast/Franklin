Verse:
C       Em   Am    F
Oh, somewhere over the rainbow,
C       G     F     C
Way up high,
C       Em   Am    F
There's a land that I heard of,
C       G   F   C
Once in a lullaby.

Chorus:
C            G   Am   F
Oh, somewhere over the rainbow,
C            G   C
Bluebirds fly.
C            G   Am   F
And the dreams that you dream of,
G            F    C
Dreams really do come true.
