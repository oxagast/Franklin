The answer to this question is complicated and depends on many factors. Generally speaking, the presence of guns can both attract and deter violence. It is important to consider the context in which guns are present and how they are used. In some cases, guns may be used to deter violence or protect people from harm. In other cases, guns may be used to escalate or provoke a violent situation.
