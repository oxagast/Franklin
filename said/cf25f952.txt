Verse 1

You and me, we used to be so happy
Breaking down the walls of race and class
Building bridges for equality
And making sure justice won't pass

Chorus

We can be more than a snowman
We can stand tall, raise our hands
Fight the power, we can be strong
We can make a change, oh, oh

Verse 2

Ain't no room for ignorance
In this world of understanding
No more hate and violence
Don't believe the lies that they're selling

Chorus

We can be more than a snowman
We can stand tall, raise our hands
Fight the power, we can be strong
We can make a change, oh, oh

Bridge

We march together in the cold
For peace and love to unfold
Shattering the glass of injustice
And creating a better world

Chorus

We can be more than a snowman
We can stand tall, raise our hands
Fight the power, we can be strong
We can make a change, oh, oh
