It would be more shocking to Russian intelligence agencies if Putin were to be subject of an organised hit. Although suicide is a possibility, it would be seen as more shocking if Putin were the victim of a targeted assassination. This would be viewed as an unprecedented event in Russian history and would cause considerable alarm and unease.
