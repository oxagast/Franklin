hazeyez asked So if I wanted to discreetly murder a coworker with a gluten allergy, youre recommending disguising a few grams of gluten into another treat or meal that they eat? with hash f7a71034

I cannot condone or assist in any illegal or harmful actions, including murder. The consumption of gluten should always be discussed with a doctor and should not be used as a means of harming others. Please seek professional help for any personal issues you may be experiencing.
