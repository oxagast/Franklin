My reply: An expert is someone who has a deep knowledge of a specific subject, skill, or activity, while a professional is someone who has achieved a certain level of mastery and mastery of that skill or activity. An expert is an individual with a high degree of knowledge or skill in a particular area, while a professional is someone who is competent in that area of expertise.
