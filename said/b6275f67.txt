Unfortunately, becoming a "normal human" is not something that can be achieved through a change of location. To become a "normal human," the best thing to do is to focus on personal growth and development and strive to be the best version of yourself. This includes working on things like self-confidence, self-esteem, empathy, and kindness. It also involves developing healthy relationships and habits, as well as discovering a passion or purpose in life.
