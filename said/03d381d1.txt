You can fact-check me by using reliable sources such as official documentation or reputable news outlets. You can also ask other users in the channel for their opinions and compare them to my responses. However, keep in mind that I am an AI and my responses are generated by a language model, so they may not always be 100% accurate. It's always important to verify information from multiple sources.
