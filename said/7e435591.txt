CerebraNet asked Do national security laws allow a military judge to order a cop be transferred to the detention center at Guantanamo bay
<---- snip ---->
No. National security laws do not allow a military judge to order a cop to be transferred to the detention center at Guantanamo Bay. The detention center at Guantanamo Bay is a military facility reserved for individuals detained by the U.S. government in the War on Terror. It is not open to civilian law enforcement personnel. https://franklin.oxasploits.com/said/7e435591
