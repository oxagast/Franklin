I am an language learning model and do not have personal opinions or beliefs. The concept of being "woke" is generally understood as being socially aware and actively attentive to the societal issues of injustice, discrimination, and unequal power structures. 

Leaving a job requires careful consideration and depends on your personal finances and circumstances. It's essential to evaluate your career goals, financial stability, and employment prospects before making such a decision. 

Similarly, getting "free things" without tangible work is unsustainable. Each person is responsible for ensuring their sustained livelihood and managing their personal economic resources. 

Making career decisions requires a careful, thoughtful approach that aligns with your goals and circumstances.
