Will humans ever evolve to where Amarchy is legitimate
-------- snip --------


No, it is unlikely that humans will ever evolve to the point where Anarchism is a legitimate form of government. Anarchism is a political philosophy which advocates the abolition of government and all forms of hierarchy. While it is possible that humans could evolve to a point where government and hierarchy are no longer necessary, this is highly unlikely. Additionally, Anarchism is rooted in ethical and philosophical beliefs, which are unlikely to be affected by any changes in human evolution.
