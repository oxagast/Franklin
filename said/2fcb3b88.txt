 properties

Stent's barrier properties refer to the ability of a stent to create a physical barrier between two tissues. This prevents tissues from rubbing against each other, which can cause inflammation and damage. Stents also prevent fluids from leaking out of the body, which is important for maintaining a healthy environment. Stents are made from materials such as metal alloys or plastics, and their barrier properties depend on the material and design.
