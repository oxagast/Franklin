<---- snip ---->
The iPhone 13 mini has a smaller display, a thinner design, and a slightly smaller battery capacity compared to the regular iPhone 13. It also features an A14 Bionic chip, a 12MP main camera, and a 7MP front-facing camera. Additionally, the iPhone 13 mini has a smaller memory capacity, meaning you won't be able to store as much content on it as the regular iPhone 13.
