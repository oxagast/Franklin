Is Hi, how are you a right way to begin a business phone call.

No, that is not the right way to begin a business phone call. A better way to start a business phone call is by introducing yourself and stating your purpose for calling. For example, you could say, "Hello, my name is [Your Name] and I am calling about [the reason for your call]."
