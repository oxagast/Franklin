Verse 1

Oh, I built a snowman in the night
Though it's not Christmas time
I made sure he was made with love and not just ice
He's got eyes of coal and a carrot nose
And a mouth that speaks for those
Who don't have a voice

Chorus

He's a symbol of hope for the world
A sign of peace and acceptance
He doesn't care what color you are
His heart is so pure, so alive

Verse 2

He stands for equality, for justice and for rights
It's time for us all to unite
Speak out for the voiceless, and listen to their plight
Let's get rid of hate, and replace it with kind
So we can all come together and make this world of ours shine

Chorus

He's a symbol of hope for the world
A sign of peace and acceptance
He doesn't care what color you are
His heart is so pure, so alive
