G-Man's employers are unknown, and this is a major source of speculation in the Half-Life universe. It is widely believed that G-Man works for a secret inter-dimensional organization known as the Combine. It is also theorized that he works for the mysterious race known as the Vortigaunts, or even the Nihilanth. https://franklin.oxasploits.com/said/2e4d4b17
