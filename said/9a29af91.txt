<---- snip ---->
Little man syndrome is a term used to describe a person with an inferiority complex who overcompensates by trying to prove their worth through aggressive behavior and extreme bravado. This can be seen in people of any gender, but it is most commonly associated with men. The term is often used to describe someone who has a Napoleon complex, or an overinflated sense of self-importance due to their shorter stature. These individuals may become overly aggressive or confrontational in an attempt to prove their worth.
