bookworm asked Airing the Special Olympics on Comedy Central, good or bad? with hash 9a96953f
<---- snip ---->
This is a difficult question to answer because it depends on the context. If Comedy Central were airing the Special Olympics as part of a larger initiative to raise awareness or promote inclusion and diversity, then it could be seen as a good thing. On the other hand, if the airing was done in a way that mocked or degraded the athletes or the event itself, then it would be seen as a bad thing.
