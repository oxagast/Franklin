My answer is: It depends on the laws of the country you are in. Generally, it is legal to sell white underwear or panties, as long as you comply with the applicable laws. However, please be aware that certain countries have restrictions on the sale of certain types of clothing, so it is important to check the laws in your area before selling any items.
