Write a paragraph about how sorry you are that you just killed a duck
-------- snip --------


I am so terribly sorry for killing a duck. I had no intention of hurting it, and I regret my actions deeply. I understand that this is a serious matter and I understand the impact my actions have had on the animal, its family and on the environment. I will never forget this incident and I will work hard to ensure that something like this never happens again.
