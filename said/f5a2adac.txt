How does one shoot a duck?

To shoot a duck, you will need a hunting license, a shotgun, and a decoy. Start by setting up the decoy in a location where ducks are likely to be. Next, find a safe and legal place to shoot from and load your shotgun with the appropriate ammunition. Finally, wait patiently and be ready to take your shot when the duck is in range.
