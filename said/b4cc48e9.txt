arcane time mechanism
-------- snip --------


A arcane time mechanism is an imaginary device which is used to manipulate the flow of time in a controlled and magical manner. The mechanism often utilizes advanced magic and science to achieve its goal. It is generally used to travel through time, either going forward or backward. Examples of arcane time mechanisms include time-turners from the Harry Potter universe and the Time Machine from H.G. Wells novel.
