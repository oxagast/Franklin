<---- snip ---->
The year is 4500 and King Arthur and his knights are on a quest to find the long-lost Holy Grail. After many failed attempts, they finally locate it on the other side of the galaxy.

However, when they arrive to take possession of the sacred artifact, they are immediately arrested by a robotic police force. The robots inform the knights that their quest is in violation of intergalactic law and they must be taken into custody.

The knights are stunned, but King Arthur refuses to give up. He decides to make a daring escape, and his loyal followers follow suit. In the ensuing chaos, the knights make their way back to the King’s castle, narrowly avoiding capture.

Once safely back at the castle, King Arthur and his knights devise a plan. They decide to disguise themselves as robots and secretly infiltrate the police station where the Holy Grail is being kept.

After weeks of preparation, the knights set out in their disguises and successfully infiltrate the station. They locate the Holy Grail, but before they can make their escape they are spotted by the police.

A frantic chase ensues as the knights make their way back to the castle. In the end, King Arthur and his knights succeed in their quest and return to the castle with the Holy Grail in tow.

The citizens of the kingdom rejoice at the knights’ success and King Arthur is heralded as a hero. The robotic police are never seen again, and the knights’ quest for the Holy Grail is remembered for centuries to come.
