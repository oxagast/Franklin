Tombstoned asked how hard would I need to throw a baseball to get it to land on the moon? with hash c22d8877

That's a difficult question to answer, as it depends on many factors such as the weight of the baseball, the angle at which it is thrown, and the gravitational pull of the moon. However, according to NASA, the escape velocity required to leave Earth's orbit and reach the moon is around 11.2 km/s. So, assuming you could throw a baseball at that speed, it would theoretically be able to land on the moon. Of course, this is just a theoretical scenario and not something that is realistically possible.
