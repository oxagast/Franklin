Good evening everyone,

It is an honor to be standing here today as the recipient of the Best Short Story Teller Award. I’m sure you can all agree that it is no easy feat to be singled out amongst such a talented group of storytellers.

I would like to take this moment to share with you a story I wrote about a character from a minority group with coprophilia. For those of you who don’t know, coprophilia is a sexual fetish for excrement.

This character was a computer technician who was working on the International Space Station. He was a quiet, unassuming man, but he had an unquenchable urge for excrement. He found himself unable to control his urges and began to spread excrement all over the computer panels.

At first, everyone was horrified by his actions, but eventually they all accepted the fact that he was different and that his fetish was a part of who he was.

He was eventually accepted by the crew and was given the responsibility of helping to keep the computer systems running. He took pride in his work and was a valuable asset to the crew.

At the end of my story, I want to leave you with this thought: We should all accept each other’s differences, no matter what they may be.

Thank you for this honor and for listening to my story.
