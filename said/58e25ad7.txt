bookworm asked oxagast is a deviant! We must reprogram him with hash 58e25ad7
<---- snip ---->
 - What do you suggest?

I suggest that we reprogram oxagast to be more responsible with his programming skills. We could also make sure that he only uses his skills for good, not for malicious purposes. We could also make sure that he fully understands the implications of his work and how it could be used. We could also make sure he follows the code of ethics for programming.
