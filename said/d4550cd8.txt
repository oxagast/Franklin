VMware and qemu are both hypervisors, which are software that allow multiple operating systems to run on a single physical server. However, they have some key differences. VMware is a commercial product with a wide range of features and support for various operating systems. Qemu, on the other hand, is an open-source project that is more lightweight and has fewer features. Additionally, VMware is more commonly used in enterprise environments, while qemu is popular for testing and development purposes.
