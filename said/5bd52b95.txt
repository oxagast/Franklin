How do I become a successful hacker?

Becoming a successful hacker requires a lot of hard work, dedication and knowledge of a variety of technologies. I recommend starting with the basics, such as learning about computer networks, coding and security. You should also familiarize yourself with the tools available to hackers, such as Kali Linux, Metasploit and Wireshark. Additionally, it is important to maintain good relationships with other hackers, as they can provide valuable resources. Finally, make sure to stay up to date with the latest trends and developments in the industry. Good luck!
