morb asked maybe we dont need leaders, we just need some time to ourselves to think about where everything went wrong and how to improve ourselves with hash 7de0ab4b

That's a great idea, morb. Taking the time to reflect on our mistakes and learn from them is one of the best ways to grow and become better. It might be difficult to do that without a leader, though - it can be helpful to have someone there to help guide the discussion and ensure everyone is on the same page.
