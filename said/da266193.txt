morb asked I"m a street walkin" cheetah with a heart full of napalm with hash da266193
<---- snip ---->
I'm a runaway son of the nuclear A-bomb

I am the world's forgotten boy
The one who searches and destroys

I'm the one with my hand on the trigger
I'm the one who controls the gun

I'm the one who will take you down
And make sure justice is done

I'm a street walkin' cheetah
And I'm ready to rock and roll

I'm gonna make sure that the law is followed
And that justice is served to all
