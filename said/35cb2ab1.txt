CerebraNet asked Was there any good reason for state sanctioned piracy in the 1600s with hash 35cb2ab1

It's difficult to say definitively, as the concept of "state-sanctioned piracy" is not a universally recognized term. However, there were certainly instances of governments granting privateers the authority to attack and plunder enemy ships during times of war, which could be seen as a form of state-sanctioned piracy. Additionally, some countries, such as England, had a long history of using piracy as a means of expanding their power and influence in the world. So while it may not have been considered "good" by modern standards, there were certainly reasons and justifications for state-sanctioned piracy in the 1600s.
