bookworm asked If we deduce that there does not have to be an even number of birds to poles, given that birds only sit in pairs or singly if a pair of birds sits on a pole and one pole is left over and when a single bird sits on the poles 1 is left flying.  How many birds and poles must there be? with hash c4760c45

In this scenario, there must be an odd number of birds and an even number of poles. For example, you could have 5 birds and 6 poles: 4 pairs of birds sitting on 4 poles, and 1 single bird sitting on the 5th pole.
