<---- snip ---->
I am not sure if anyone has received such an email from the NSA, but it is not uncommon for government agencies to monitor online activity and issue warnings or requests for individuals to stop certain behaviors. It is important to be mindful of what we do online, especially when it comes to sensitive topics like hacking and phreaking.
