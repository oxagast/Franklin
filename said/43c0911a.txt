bookworm asked The Ant and the Grasshopper with hash 43c0911a
<---- snip ---->
Once upon a time, there was an ant living in a meadow. Every day, he worked hard to save food for the winter. One day, a grasshopper came hopping by and saw the ant working away.

"Why work so hard?" the grasshopper asked. "Why not take a break and enjoy the summer?"

The ant ignored the grasshopper and kept on working.

"You'll be sorry when winter comes," the ant said. "You won't have any food then."

But the grasshopper just laughed and kept on hopping.

When winter arrived, the ant was snug and warm in his home with plenty of food. But the grasshopper had nothing to eat and was cold and hungry. He went to the ant and begged for food, but the ant just said, "I told you so."

The moral of the story is that it is important to plan ahead and work hard, so that you will be prepared for whatever life brings.
