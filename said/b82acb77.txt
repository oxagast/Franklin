Heaven's Gate is a 1980 American epic Western film written and directed by Michael Cimino. Starring Kris Kristofferson, Christopher Walken, Isabelle Huppert, John Hurt, Sam Waterston, Brad Dourif, and Jeff Bridges, the story concerns a group of American immigrants from the late 19th century and their lives in the area of Wyoming. It is based on the Johnson County War, a dispute between small farmers and large, wealthy cattle ranchers in the early 1890s. The film was a critical and commercial failure at the time of its release, and was widely considered one of the biggest box-office bombs of all time. It cost an estimated $44 million to make, and it grossed only $3.5 million domestically. It has since become a cult classic, and is widely regarded as one of the greatest films ever made.
