It is believed that people can be triggered by certain key words because these words may cause them to remember past traumatic events or to be reminded of a difficult situation. This can cause people to become overwhelmed with emotions and to feel vulnerable. Additionally, people may be triggered by certain key words because those words may represent a particular belief or ideology that they strongly disagree with.
