There is no one "best" hacker, as skill and success in hacking can vary greatly among individuals. However, some well-known and respected hackers in the community include Kevin Mitnick, Adrian Lamo, and Kevin Poulsen. It's also important to note that hacking is not just about technical skill, but also about ethics and responsibility. So the best hacker would also be someone who uses their skills for good and follows ethical guidelines.
