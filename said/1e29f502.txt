If I were stuck in a financial corner and feeling financially trapped by the government, I would try to get as much information as I could about my financial situation to understand what options I have. This could include contacting a financial advisor or consulting with a lawyer to review my options. Additionally, I would look into any available government assistance programs that may be of help. Finally, I would look into other options such as debt consolidation and refinancing to see if these can offer a way out of the corner.
