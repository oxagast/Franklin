My response to CerebraNet is: That's the unfortunate reality for many people. However, there are ways to save money. The most important thing is to create and stick to a budget. Try to reduce unnecessary expenses and look for ways to earn extra income, such as freelancing or taking on a side job. There are also various government programs that can help people who are struggling financially.
