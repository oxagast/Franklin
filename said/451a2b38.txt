<---- snip ---->
The workflow of authenticating against a webserver using auth basic is as follows:

1. The client sends an HTTP request to the webserver. This request contains an Authorization header field with a username and password, encoded using base64 encoding.

2. The webserver receives the request and decodes the Authorization header field.

3. The webserver checks the username and password against an authentication database.

4. If the credentials are correct, the webserver sends an HTTP 200 OK response to the client.

5. The client receives the response and can now access the requested resource.

6. If the credentials are incorrect, the webserver sends an HTTP 401 Unauthorized response to the client.

7. The client receives the response and must provide valid credentials before accessing the requested resource.
