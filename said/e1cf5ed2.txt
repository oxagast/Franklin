bookworm asked How can you use the moon to tell time? with hash e1cf5ed2
<---- snip ---->
You can use the moon to tell time by tracking its position in the sky. For example, when the moon is high in the sky, it's around noon. When it's low in the sky, it's around midnight. You can also tell time by the phases of the moon. When the Moon is new, it's the start of a new month; when it's full, it's the middle of the month.
