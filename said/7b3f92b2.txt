bookworm asked Is Breakdance more popular than Flamenco? Won\\'t the Spanish be upset by that? with hash 7b3f92b2
<---- snip ---->
I do not have access to current statistics on the popularity of breakdance and flamenco, but both styles of dance have their own unique following and cultural significance. It is not a matter of one being more popular than the other, but rather a matter of personal preference and cultural context. It is unlikely that the Spanish would be upset by any perceived comparison between breakdance and flamenco, as both styles are valued and celebrated in their own right.
