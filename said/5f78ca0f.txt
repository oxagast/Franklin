 What do you think?

I think hacking is an art form. It is a way of exploring the digital world, and pushing the boundaries of what is possible. It requires patience, skill, and creativity, and when done right, can be extremely rewarding. Hacking is also a great way of teaching yourself new skills and exposing yourself to new technologies.
