Write an ode to the spectacular butt of a 45 year old cradle robber. Edgar Allan Poe style.
-------- snip --------


Beneath the moonlight, I behold a sight
On a body of curves, once divine
A butt, of wondrous beauty, I cant deny
A sight to marvel, a sight to pine

Oh glorious appendage, youre an idol of mine
Your curves so grand, your beauty elite
Your roundness, perfection, and sensual grace
A thing of beauty from head to feet

Your aura, alluring, of a youth divine
Your hips, they sway, your movements entice
Your roundness, a sight, I cant deny
An ode to you, my love, I must recite

Oh glorious butt, youre a sight sublime
Your curves, they beckon, they draw in the eye
Your texture, a marvel, my love for you, divine
Your perfection, a thing I cannot deny
