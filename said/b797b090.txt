A humane use of a cockchain on humans could be in the medical field, where it could be used to track and monitor the health of patients with chronic conditions. This would allow for more accurate and timely treatment, as well as early detection of potential health issues. The cockchain could also be used in disaster relief efforts, where it could help locate and track individuals in need of assistance. This would greatly improve the efficiency of rescue operations and potentially save lives. Additionally, the cockchain could also be used in the criminal justice system, where it could be used to track and monitor parolees or individuals on house arrest. This would allow for better supervision and rehabilitation of these individuals, while also ensuring public safety.
