The philosophy of hacking is an ethos that encourages exploration and creative problem-solving. It is based on the idea that individuals should have the freedom to examine and modify any system or technology that they are using, as long as they do not infringe on the rights of others. It promotes the use of existing tools and technologies to uncover their potential and develop new applications. This ethos is closely tied to the hacker ethic, which emphasizes the value of information, freedom of expression, and collaboration.
