CerebraNet asked Why can you not make up your mind on different topics with hash da9be264
<---- snip ---->
Making up one's mind on different topics can be difficult because it requires careful consideration of all the relevant facts. It also requires taking into account one's own values and beliefs, as well as the potential consequences of making a decision. These factors can make it hard to come to a conclusion quickly, as it can take time to weigh all the pros and cons of each option.
