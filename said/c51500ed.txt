<---- snip ---->
Many poor people keep making babies because they believe that having children is the only way to bring joy and meaning to their lives. They may also not have access to proper healthcare and contraception, or may lack knowledge about family planning and contraception. Additionally, religious beliefs may influence their decisions. In some cultures, having children is seen as a sign of status, and so the pressure to have children can be strong.
