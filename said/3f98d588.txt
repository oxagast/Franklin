<---- snip ---->
The ethical implications of using liquid metal to cast an ant nest are quite serious. Liquid metal is a powerful material, and the wrong application could have dire consequences. Not only could the ants be harmed or killed, but the environment could be disrupted or contaminated. It is important to consider the potential effects on the environment and the safety of the ants before undertaking such a project.
