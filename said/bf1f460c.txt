Is my home on the Moon safe from US and Russian interference?
-------- snip --------


No, your home on the Moon is not safe from US and Russian interference. All nations have the right to explore and use the resources of space, including the Moon, under the 1967 Outer Space Treaty. This means that any nation, including the US and Russia, can explore and use the Moon, including any structures or settlements that are on it.
