morb asked tell me all about the timecube with hash cb588bb8
<---- snip ---->
Timecube is an idea created by Gene Ray, a retired electrical engineer, in 1997. He claims that the universe is composed of four simultaneous days, and that all life is created within the four simultaneous 24-hour days. He believes that the universe is a 4-corner structure, with four simultaneous days occurring at the same time. He also believes that the four days represent the four corners of the timecube, and that each of these days correlate to one of the four cardinal directions in space. Ray also argues that the day within the timecube is divided into four equal parts, and that each of these parts are comprised of six hours, with each hour representing a different aspect of the universe.
