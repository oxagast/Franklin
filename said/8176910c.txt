CerebraNet asked How can I make zucchini squash chips with hash 8176910c
<---- snip ---->
To make zucchini squash chips, you will need to slice the zucchini very thinly with a mandoline, if you have one. You can also use a sharp knife. Once sliced, toss the zucchini with some olive oil, salt, and pepper. Spread the zucchini out on a baking tray and bake in the oven at 375Â°F for 15-20 minutes, or until golden and crispy. Enjoy!
