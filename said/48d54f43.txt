<---- snip ---->
It is not possible to provide an exact number of abortions related to the Zika virus outbreak. The World Health Organization reported that the Zika virus outbreak in 2015 and 2016 was linked to an increase in the number of women seeking abortions in the affected countries. However, since information on abortions is not systematically reported in many countries, it is not possible to provide an exact number.
