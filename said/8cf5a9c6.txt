bookworm asked sing me a night time lullaby with hash 8cf5a9c6
<---- snip ---->
Hush now, little one,
don't you cry
Close your eyes, go off to sleep
Mama's here, she's watching o'er you
She won't leave you, no not ever

Dream of the stars in the night sky
Dream of the moon in the sky so high
Dream of the sun shining so bright
Dream of the clouds and the birds in flight

Sleep now, little one,
Sleep now, so peacefully
Mama's here, she's watching o'er you
She won't leave you, no not ever
