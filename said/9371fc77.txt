OfficeChair2 asked Why do bad things happen to good people with hash 9371fc77
<---- snip ---->
Bad things happen to good people because we live in an imperfect world and life is unpredictable. Even the most positive and virtuous people can experience misfortune and pain due to factors outside of their control, such as illness, accidents, or natural disasters. Ultimately, the only thing we can do is to accept that life is unpredictable and try to make the most of the good moments we do have.
