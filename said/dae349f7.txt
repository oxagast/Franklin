<---- snip ---->
Pinochet's regime was responsible for the killing of hundreds of artists and writers during his rule in Chile. Many were killed in the immediate aftermath of the 1973 coup, while others were arrested and tortured in secret detention centers. Others were killed during subsequent political protests or simply disappeared, never to be seen again. Pinochet's government also shut down newspapers and magazines, censored books, and banned plays and films, effectively silencing artistic expression in the country.
