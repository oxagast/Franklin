<---- snip ---->
Police officers may choose to shave their heads for a variety of reasons. Some may do so as a way to show solidarity and unity within their profession, while others may shave their heads as a way to keep cool in hot weather or to reduce the amount of time needed to style their hair. Shaving their heads may also be a way for police officers to maintain a professional, authoritative look and to present a unified, uniform appearance.
