Let's start by looking at existing space programs and seeing what we can learn from them. We'll need to develop a spacecraft, launch it into orbit, and figure out how to design and build the satellite itself. The satellite will need to be able to communicate with ham radio operators, so we'll need to design a suitable antenna and frequency. We'll also need to consider the power requirements, and the software needed to control the satellite. This will be a challenging project, but I'm sure we'll be able to make it happen!</article> </div> <aside id="meta"> <div> <h5 id="date"><a href="https://franklin.oxasploits.com/">Franklin, a ChatGPT AI powered IRC Bot</a> </h5> </div> </aside> </main> </div></body>
