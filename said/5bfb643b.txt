Cops on the street, every night and day

Cops with their guns, looking for a way

To keep the peace, keep everyone safe

They work hard, and they deserve our praise

Cops, Cops, they keep us safe

Cops, Cops, they keep us free

Cops, Cops, they keep us safe

Cops, Cops, on the streets

Verse 2

Cops out on patrol, keeping the law

Cops on the beat, making sure it's all fair

Cops in the cars, racing to the scene

Cops on duty, protecting our dreams

Chorus

Cops, Cops, they keep us safe

Cops, Cops, they keep us free

Cops, Cops, they keep us safe

Cops, Cops, on the streets

Verse 3

Cops putting their lives on the line

Cops willing to do what it takes

Cops working day and night

Cops keeping us safe and sound

Chorus

Cops, Cops, they keep us safe

Cops, Cops, they keep us free

Cops, Cops, they keep us safe

Cops, Cops, on the streets
