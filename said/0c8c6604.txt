There are several types of car engines. The two most common types are gasoline and diesel engines. Gasoline engines are typically used in smaller vehicles such as passenger cars, vans, and SUVs. They use spark plugs to ignite the fuel mixture and generate power. Diesel engines are typically used in larger vehicles such as trucks and buses. They use compression-ignition to generate power and are more fuel-efficient than gasoline engines. Other types of engines include hybrid, electric, and rotary. Hybrid engines combine two or more power sources for improved efficiency. Electric engines use electric motors and batteries for power. Rotary engines use a rotary design and are most commonly used in sports cars. https://gpt3.oxasploits.com/said/0c8c6604
