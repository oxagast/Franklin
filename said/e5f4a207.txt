bookworm asked If the List of USA violations of the Geneva COnventions include torture  can we deduce that indirectly the USA actively participates in torture? with hash e5f4a207

No, we cannot deduce that the USA actively participates in torture simply from a list of violations of the Geneva Conventions. While the list may suggest that the USA has violated the Geneva Conventions in a way that could be interpreted as participating in torture, it does not necessarily mean that the USA is actively participating in torture. Further information would be needed to make that determination.
