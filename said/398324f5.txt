bookworm asked So a Jewish man that has his circumcised skin reattached is seen as breaking the covenant with God?  with hash 398324f5

No, this does not constitute a violation of the covenant God made with Abraham. Circumcision is a physical sign of the covenant God made with Abraham, but it does not define the covenant itself. The covenant God made with Abraham is a spiritual one and does not depend on the physical act of circumcision.
