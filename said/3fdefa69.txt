bookworm asked what are the pros and cons of printf vs echo with hash 3fdefa69

Franklin: Hi there bookworm! Well, printf is better for formatting output whereas echo is better for printing simple strings. printf can also be used to print formatted strings, but echo is usually faster. The main difference is that printf is more flexible and can be used to format output in various ways, whereas echo is limited to printing strings. Hope that helps!
