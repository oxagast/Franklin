Once upon a time, there was a brave little yogurt container named Poop. Poop was the bravest yogurt container in all of the land, and he had a dream - to be the most delicious yogurt around. 

One day, Poop decided he was going to try to make the most delicious yogurt ever created, and he set off on a quest to find the perfect ingredients. After searching high and low, Poop eventually found what he was looking for - the most delicious and creamy milk, some ripe and juicy fruits, and the creamiest, most delicious yogurt culture. 

Armed with his ingredients, Poop set about making the most delicious yogurt the world had ever seen. After carefully stirring the mixture, Poop placed the yogurt in the fridge to chill. Once it was ready, Poop opened the fridge to reveal the most beautiful yogurt container anyone had ever seen. The yogurt was creamy and delicious, and Poop knew he had succeeded in his quest.

And so, Poop yogurt was born. It quickly became the most popular yogurt in the land, and people would line up for miles just to get a taste of the delicious treat. Poop yogurt was so delicious that it even became a bedtime story, one that was told to children all across the land. 

The moral of the story is this - never give up on your dreams, no matter how hard they may seem. With a little hard work and determination, anything is possible.
