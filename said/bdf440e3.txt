The End of Time

The universe was a vast and empty expanse, filled only with the remnants of galaxies long since gone. For Billions and Billions of years, there had been nothing but silence and stillness. Until one day, in a distant corner of the universe, a single atom began to move.

Slowly, at first, then faster, the atom began to vibrate, creating an ever-expanding ripple that spread across the universe. As it moved, it gathered more and more energy, until it had become a massive wave of energy, crashing through the darkness and bringing with it a brilliant light.

The wave continued to grow, until it reached the furthest reaches of the universe, and suddenly, the universe began to expand at an incredible rate. The galaxies and stars that had been so still and silent for so long now seemed to be rushing by in a blur.

At the centre of the wave, the single atom had become a brilliant star, so bright that it lit up the entire universe. And then, as suddenly as it had started, the wave stopped, and the universe returned to its normal pace.

The star at the centre of the wave was no longer just a star, but a portal. A portal to a new universe, a universe of infinite possibilities. And as the last few atoms of the old universe disappeared into the portal, time itself seemed to stand still.

The End of Time had come.
