What is the best protein source for cats
-------- snip --------


The best protein source for cats is high quality animal protein from sources like chicken, beef, fish, lamb, or turkey. These types of protein are easier for cats to digest and more closely mimic the type of meat cats would eat in the wild. High quality protein sources also provide cats with essential amino acids and fatty acids.
