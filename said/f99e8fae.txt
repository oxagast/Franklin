tell me how a boat floats

A boat is able to float because it is filled with air-filled compartments, which displace a large amount of water, providing buoyancy. The boats weight is counteracted by the upward force of the water, which is equal to the weight of the water displaced by the boat. This is known as the principle of buoyancy.
