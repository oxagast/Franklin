Why must the amounts of ingredients in some recipes be reduced when cooking above a certain high altitude? 
-------- snip --------


When cooking at high altitudes, the atmospheric pressure is lower, meaning that water boils at a lower temperature. This causes the ingredients in a recipe to cook more quickly, and so the amounts of ingredients must be reduced to avoid over-cooking or burning the food. Additionally, the lower atmospheric pressure causes the air to be less dense, meaning that leavening agents like baking soda and baking powder are less effective. Consequently, the amounts of these ingredients must also be reduced when cooking at high altitudes.
