oxagast asked why are cats so stupid, is it the samll brain
<---- snip ---->
Unfortunately, there is no scientific research to support the idea that cats are "stupid." Cats are intelligent creatures that have evolved to be excellent hunters and survivors. They are more selective in the way they interact with people and their environment, which may lead to the misconception that they are not as intelligent as other animals. https://franklin.oxasploits.com/said/c30976c8
