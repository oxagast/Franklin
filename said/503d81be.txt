<---- snip ---->
The best cure for Achilles Tendonitis is to rest the tendon and to reduce any activities that can cause inflammation. You should also stretch the calf muscles before and after exercise, and use a good quality shoe to support your feet. You can also try using nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen to reduce the pain and inflammation. If the condition does not improve with these treatments, you should consult your doctor for further advice.
