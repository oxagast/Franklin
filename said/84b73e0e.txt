<---- snip ---->
There is no one answer to this question; opinions on why Nebraska “sucks” can vary from person to person. Some people may think that Nebraska’s economy, climate, or culture are not ideal for them. Others may find that the state is too rural or lacks entertainment options. Ultimately, opinions on Nebraska will depend on the individual and their personal preferences.
