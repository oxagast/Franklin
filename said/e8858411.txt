captain asked sing a jazzy tune
<---- snip ---->
 
♫ I'm gonna take a ride 
On a jazzy tune
It's gonna be so fine 
I'll be singing in the morning light
Oh what a sweet delight 
I'm gonna swing and sway 
To the rhythm of the day
It's gonna be so grand 
As I'm singing a jazzy tune ♫ https://gpt3.oxasploits.com/said/e8858411
