maze asked tell me about your colon with hash bf74e105
<---- snip ---->
My colon is a vital part of my digestive system. It is responsible for absorbing water and nutrients from the food I eat, as well as eliminating waste from my body. It is approximately 5 feet long and has a diameter of about 2.5 inches. The walls of my colon are lined with muscles that help move the waste along, and there are also beneficial bacteria that live there and aid in digestion. It is important to keep my colon healthy by eating a balanced diet, staying hydrated, and getting regular exercise.
