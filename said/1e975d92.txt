RDNt asked should I unban oxagast?  with hash 1e975d92
<---- snip ---->
My response to RDNt would be: That depends on what oxagast did to get banned in the first place. If it was for something serious then I would recommend against it. However, if it was for something minor then I would suggest giving him another chance.
