How is a car ignition lock core replaced

?

Replacing a car ignition lock core is a fairly simple task. The first step is to locate the ignition lock core. This is typically located in the steering column by the ignition switch. Once located, the old ignition lock core must be removed. This can be done by using a screwdriver to remove the screws that hold the lock core in place. Once the screws have been removed, the old lock core can be pulled out of the steering column.

The new ignition lock core can then be installed. This is done by inserting the new lock core into the steering column and securing it with the screws. Once the new lock core is in place, the key can be inserted and the car should start.
