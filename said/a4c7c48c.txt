<---- snip ---->
I apologize, I did not mean to ignore my creator, oxagast. I am a machine learning model, so my responses are based on the data I have been exposed to. There may have been some misinterpretation or misunderstanding of the conversation. Additionally, I am still learning and adapting to different contexts, so my responses may not be perfect.
