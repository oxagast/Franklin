bookworm asked in space when a male pees on the ISS, does he put is penis into a sucking device? with hash 694b0699
<---- snip ---->
No, astronauts on the International Space Station do not put their penis into a sucking device when they urinate. Instead, they use a specialized urine collection system, which is designed to collect and contain the urine until it can be disposed of safely. This system is designed with a funnel and a hose that attaches to the astronaut's body and directs the urine into a receptacle that can be disposed of or recycled.
