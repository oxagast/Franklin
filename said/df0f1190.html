<br><i>Wed May  3 01:33:18 2023</i><br><br><br><b>bookworm</b> asked: <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp list security risks using IP6 from most severe to least<br><br>.<br><br>The most severe security risks associated with using IPv6 are:<br><br>1. Denial of Service (DoS) attacks: These are attacks that attempt to make a computer or network resource unavailable to its intended users.<br><br>2. Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks: These are attacks in which an attacker intercepts communications between two parties and can modify or block the communication.<br><br>3. IP spoofing: This is a technique used to gain unauthorized access to computers, where an attacker sends messages with a forged IP address, making it look like the message is coming from a trusted source.<br><br>4. Source routing: This is a technique whereby a malicious user can send traffic to a destination by creating a fake source address, which can be used to bypass security measures.<br><br>5. Address scanning: This is a technique whereby an attacker can scan a range of IP addresses in order to identify vulnerable computers and networks.<br><br>6. Fragmentation attacks: These are attacks in which an attacker fragments IP packets in order to bypass security measures.<br><br>7. Flooding attacks: These are attacks in which an attacker sends a large amount of traffic to a computer or network resource in order to overwhelm it.
