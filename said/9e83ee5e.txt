As a death row inmate, you may be executed by lethal injection, electrocution, gas chamber, hanging, or firing squad, depending on the state and its laws. Each method carries its own risks and potential for pain and suffering. It is a controversial and complex issue, and ultimately, the decision of how to carry out an execution lies with the state and its laws.
