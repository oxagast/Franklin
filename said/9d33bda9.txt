gun silencer use should be mandatory in the USA
-------- snip --------


No, silencer use should not be mandatory in the USA. While silencers can muffle the sound of a gun being fired, they can also make it difficult to locate the source of the gunshot. Additionally, silencers can make it difficult for law enforcement to distinguish between a real gun and a toy gun, potentially leading to confusion in a dangerous situation.
