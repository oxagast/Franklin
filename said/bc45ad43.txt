give us a history lesson of IRC
-------- snip --------


IRC (Internet Relay Chat) is a form of real-time Internet text messaging (chat) or synchronous conferencing. It was first developed in 1988 by Jarkko Oikarinen in Finland.

IRC was originally used as an instant messaging system for chatting with other users on a single server. As the technology evolved, IRC networks were developed, allowing users from multiple servers to connect and communicate with each other.

Today, IRC is used for a variety of purposes, including group discussion, online support, and gaming. IRC is also used by hackers and other cybercriminals to coordinate their activities and share information.

The use of IRC has been in decline since the mid-2000s, as more modern alternatives such as instant messaging and social networking sites have become popular. However, it remains popular among certain groups, such as gamers and open source developers.
