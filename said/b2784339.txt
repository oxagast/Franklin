Given the catastrophic consequences of nuclear war, it is highly unlikely that a proxy war between Russia and the United States would be allowed to escalate to the point of a nuclear response. Instead, diplomatic efforts from both sides would be expected to be employed to de-escalate the situation. This could include the use of economic sanctions, diplomatic negotiations, and other forms of international pressure. Ultimately, the goal would be to reach an agreement between the two countries that would bring an end to the conflict.
