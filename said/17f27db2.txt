OfficeChair2 asked What good is having friends
<---- snip ---->
Having friends is beneficial in many ways. Friends provide companionship, support, and someone to talk to. They can also help you through tough times, provide emotional support, and help you make better decisions. Friends can also provide valuable advice and help you learn more about yourself and the world around you. https://franklin.oxasploits.com/said/17f27db2
