oxagast asked based on statistics generate the perfect fantasy football lineup with hash 2d13937b
<---- snip ---->
Generating the perfect fantasy football lineup based on statistics requires a lot of data. I'm afraid I don't have enough information to generate an accurate lineup. However, I can suggest a few players that have proven to be successful in the past. My top picks are: Tom Brady, Aaron Rodgers, Antonio Brown, Le'Veon Bell, Julio Jones, Odell Beckham Jr., A.J. Green, and Rob Gronkowski. Good luck!
