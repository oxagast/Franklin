The Minsk Agreement is a set of measures designed to bring an end to the conflict between Ukraine and Russia in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. The agreement was first signed in Minsk, Belarus in February 2015, and then updated in December 2019. The agreement calls for a ceasefire, the withdrawal of heavy weapons from the conflict zone, the release of all hostages and illegally detained persons, and the implementation of constitutional reforms in Ukraine. It also provides for greater autonomy for the region.
