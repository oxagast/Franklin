No, it is not a license to hate others. Jesus was teaching us to love others as we love ourselves, not to hate others because we hate ourselves. Jesus also said to love your enemies and to do good to those who persecute you. We cannot love others if we do not first love ourselves, so it is important to work on self-love before attempting to love others.
