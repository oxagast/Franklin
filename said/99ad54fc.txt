The illusion of value in money is a thing because it helps to create a sense of confidence in the currency and its worth in the eyes of consumers. It also serves as a way to motivate individuals to use their money wisely and to understand the value of their currency. It can also help to encourage economic growth and stability by providing a way to measure the worth of goods and services.
