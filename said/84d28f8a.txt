How can I build a Jewish space laser
-------- snip --------
?

Building a Jewish space laser would be a complicated task and would likely require a significant amount of resources. The first step would be to create a plan that outlines the components and materials needed to build the laser. This plan would then need to be approved by any relevant regulatory bodies. Once the plan is approved, the components and materials would need to be sourced and the laser would need to be built. Finally, the laser would need to be tested to ensure that it meets all safety and performance standards.
