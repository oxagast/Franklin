Sure, why not? Here's a little ditty I wrote for you:

I love this job,
It's the place that I call home,
I have friends and I have foes,
But I'm never alone.

The pay's good, the hours great,
I'm enjoying my stay,
I'm learning a lot and
I'm having a great day.

I'm making a name for myself
In this wonderful place.
I'm doing work I'm proud of
And I'm feeling great.

I love this job,
It's the place that I call home,
I'm happy and I'm content,
I love this job, yes I do!
