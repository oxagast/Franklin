Sorry to hear about your Crohn's. Here are some appetizer suggestions that should be safe for you: gluten-free hummus with vegetables, cucumber and avocado rolls, quinoa salad, gluten-free crackers with dairy-free cheese, rice paper rolls with tofu and vegetables, gluten-free bruschetta with balsamic glaze, and gluten-free mini quiches with a crust made from almond flour. Let me know if you need any more ideas.
