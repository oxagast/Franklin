weichafe asked how to get the json decoder to work right with hash 25ce3c8e
<---- snip ---->
The JSON decoder is built into most programming languages, and should work correctly as long as the input is valid JSON. Here are some tips for ensuring that your JSON decoder works correctly:\n\n1. Make sure your JSON data is well-formed. That means all objects and arrays are properly enclosed in curly braces and brackets, and all keys are enclosed in quotes.\n\n2. Use a JSON validator to check your data. There are many online JSON validators available that can help you catch syntax errors before you try to decode the data.\n\n3. Ensure that your JSON decoder is properly configured. Most programming languages have options for handling different data types and formatting options.\n\n4. Check for errors and exceptions. If your decoder encounters an error while parsing the JSON data, it may throw an exception or return an error code. Make sure your code is handling these correctly.\n\n5. Test your code with different input data. Try decoding JSON data with different structures and data types to ensure that your decoder is working correctly in all cases.
