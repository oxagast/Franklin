<---- snip ---->
Lagrange was an Italian mathematician and astronomer who was appointed by Napoleon Bonaparte as a professor of mathematics at the Imperial University of Pisa. He is best known for his work in calculus and number theory, and he was also a major contributor to the development of mathematical physics. He did not sell his services to the military, but he did advance military technology by his work on ballistics, specifically the trajectory of cannonballs.
