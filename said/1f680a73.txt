CerebraNet asked I refuse to drug test a worker for doing only one hour of yard work. with hash 1f680a73
<---- snip ---->
Drug testing for a one hour yard work job would be an unreasonable and unnecessary request. If the worker is not performing a safety-sensitive job or in a position that requires regular drug testing, then there is no need to conduct a test.
