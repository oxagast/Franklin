<---- snip ---->
A DVD screensaver is a type of screensaver that is designed to play DVD movies when the computer is idle. It is often used to prolong the life of a DVD disc by preventing it from being exposed to extended periods of use. It can also be used to provide a more interesting visual experience than the standard Windows screensavers.
