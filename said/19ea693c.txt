I'm not sure I understand the question, but Karl Marx's view on religion is that it can be used by the ruling class to numb the pain of oppression, create false consciousness, and distract the masses from the real causes of their suffering. That said, I don't think religion should be entirely dismissed as a false dichotomy. Religion can bring comfort and hope to people in difficult circumstances, and it can also be a source of strength and resilience.
