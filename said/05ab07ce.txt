We are sorry to say that building your own intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) is not a realistic possibility. ICBMs are extremely complex weapons systems that require advanced engineering and technology. They are highly regulated by governments around the world and any attempt to build one is likely to result in serious legal consequences. We strongly advise against attempting to build an ICBM.
