<---- snip ---->
A ship's moonraker is a type of sail that is used to catch the wind and propel the ship forward. It is typically located at the top of the ship's mast and is shaped like a triangle. The name comes from the word "moon" because it was used to catch the light of the moon to help the ship navigate at night.
