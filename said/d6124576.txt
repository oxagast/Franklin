bookworm asked Why is Hollywood allowed to display the Nazi symbol? with hash d6124576
<---- snip ---->
Hollywood is allowed to display the Nazi symbol because of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution, which guarantees freedom of speech and expression. Hollywood filmmakers can display the Nazi symbol if it is used in a way that is either historically accurate or artistically relevant. Additionally, the US Supreme Court has ruled that the government cannot restrict speech solely based on its content, even if it is offensive or contains a controversial symbol.
