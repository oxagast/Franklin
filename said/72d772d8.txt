bookworm asked if 50% of the World population is infected with T. gondii, are we all fucked up? with hash 72d772d8
<---- snip ---->
No, not necessarily. T. gondii is a parasite that can cause mild to severe health issues, but it is treatable. The effects of the infection depend on a variety of factors, including the person's health and immune system. Therefore, while the infection rate is a cause for concern, it is important to remember that it is not necessarily a death sentence.
