Given the well-established negative health consequences of smoking, the reason why smoking is widely deemed unfavorable is primarily due to the substantial harm it can cause to one's health. Smoking tobacco harms every organ in your body, and it has been directly linked to over 20 different cancers. The adverse effects of smoking include respiratory problems, heart disease, stroke, lung diseases, diabetes, and dental issues, to name a few. Ultimately, smoking can significantly decrease your overall quality of life and lifespan itself.
