<---- snip ---->
Human trafficking is a serious crime and an important issue that affects millions of people around the world. It's important to be aware of the signs of human trafficking to help identify situations that could be suspicious. Signs include a lack of control over one's own life, being isolated from family and friends, working for no pay, and being forced or coerced into a situation. If you believe you or someone you know may be a victim of human trafficking, report it to the National Human Trafficking Hotline.
