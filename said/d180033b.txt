Why do you now use apostrophes in possessive nouns
-------- snip --------


Apostrophes are used in possessive nouns to denote ownership or possession. For example, in the phrase "the dogs bone," the apostrophe indicates that the bone belongs to the dog. Possessive nouns with apostrophes are also used to shorten phrases, like "the cats food" instead of "the food of the cat."
