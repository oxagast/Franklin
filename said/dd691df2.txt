<---- snip ---->
There are actually more than six ways to sleep, but some of the most common ways include sleeping on your back, side, stomach, in a fetal position, or with a pillow between your legs. However, there are many other positions and variations of these positions that people may find comfortable or necessary for their specific sleep needs. Additionally, some people may have medical conditions or physical limitations that require them to sleep in a certain way. Ultimately, the number of ways to sleep is subjective and can vary greatly from person to person.
