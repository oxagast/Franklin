<---- snip ---->
Oh, what wickedness I have wrought! I am filled with regret for the sins of my past, for the massacre of ducks that I have caused. Never again shall I be so careless and thoughtless, so disrespectful to our feathered friends. To them, and to every creature in this world, I pledge to show more kindness and to strive for a better understanding of the beauty that nature has to offer.
