bookworm asked can quantum physics be used to travel faster than light? with hash 4bff8172
<---- snip ---->
That's a great question! While it is theoretically possible to travel faster than light using quantum physics, it is not currently possible to do so in practice. However, there is a lot of research being done in this field, so who knows what the future may hold!
