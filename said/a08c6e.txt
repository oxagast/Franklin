The point of working is to provide a service or a product that is of value to an employer or a customer. When you dont get paid enough, it can be difficult to make ends meet and maintain a healthy lifestyle. Having fair and adequate wages is essential for workers to be able to take care of themselves and their families. Without fair wages, people may be unable to afford basic necessities and may be forced to live in poverty.
