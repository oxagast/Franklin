It would likely take days, if not weeks, to hunt, cook and eat the top 10 wealth hoarders. The amount of time would depend on the location and resources available to the hunter, as well as the size and type of game the hunter is trying to catch. It would also depend on the size of the wealth hoarders and how much time it would take to cook them.
