A clipper chip is a type of microchip that was developed in the 1990s by the National Security Agency (NSA) for use in encryption devices. It was designed to provide a backdoor for law enforcement to access encrypted communication. However, it sparked controversy and was never widely adopted due to concerns about privacy and security.
