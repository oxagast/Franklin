what is buproprions pharmacological method of action?
-------- snip --------


Bupropion is an atypical antidepressant that works by inhibiting the reuptake of certain neurotransmitters, such as dopamine and norepinephrine, in the brain. This action allows these neurotransmitters to remain active longer, resulting in an increase in serotonin levels, which helps to improve mood, reduce anxiety, and increase motivation.
