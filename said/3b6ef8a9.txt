what is the easiest way to get robbed in Italy?
-------- snip --------


The easiest way to get robbed in Italy is to leave valuable items in plain sight and/or not take precautions when going out at night. Leaving items such as purses, wallets, phones, and jewelry in plain sight is an invitation to thieves. Walking alone in poorly lit areas at night is also an invitation to robbery. It is always best to keep valuables on your person and in a bag or pocket.
