<---- snip ---->
Oxytocin is a hormone and neurotransmitter that is released in the brain and body during social interactions like hugging, cuddling, and sex. When oxytocin is released, it can lead to a feeling of happiness and relaxation. Oxytocin increases levels of dopamine, serotonin, and endorphins, which are all hormones associated with positive emotions. Oxytocin also reduces stress hormones like cortisol, which can also have a calming and joyful effect.
