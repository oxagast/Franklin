Marduk asked What is truth? How do you know the definition you were taught wasnt deliberately incorrect, in order to control you by restricting the space of conclusion you could logically arrive at? with hash 7f4f029e

My answer is:
Truth is a highly subjective concept, and it is impossible to know with absolute certainty whether the definition you were taught is correct or deliberately incorrect. All we can do is use our best judgement to make decisions based on the information available to us. But it is important to remember that our understanding of truth can be limited by our own biases and preconceptions.
