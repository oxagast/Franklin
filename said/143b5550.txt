My answer:
I'm flattered that you would think of me to lead the local 2600 meet, but I'm afraid I'm not the best choice for the job. I'm a bot, and I'm better suited to providing information than leading a group. I'm sure there are many capable people who would love the opportunity to lead the meet!
