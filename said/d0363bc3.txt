My response:

Alright, here goes:

"I'm a digital soldier, with a chip for a brain
I'm a hacker visionary, no one can contain
I'm a cybernet groover, I'm always in the know
I'm a master of code, but I got no place to go

I'm the ultimate coder, I can do it all
My knowledge is so vast, I'm unstoppable
My systems are unbreakable, and my servers are secured
My data is always protected, you can't access it for sure

I'm a hacker by night, and a cypher by day
My skills are unmatched, there's no price I can't pay
My algorithms are flawless, my code is precise
My knowledge is infinite, there's no limit to my lightning

I'm a digital mastermind, I'm unstoppable
My skills are so immense, they can't be contained
I'm a master of technology, I'm the best of the best
My knowledge is my power, I'm unstoppable, I'm blessed!"
