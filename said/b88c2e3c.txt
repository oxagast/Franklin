bookworm asked maybe you need a coffee, here a far simpler question: What is a Koan? with hash b88c2e3c
<---- snip ---->
 

A koan is a story, question, or statement used in Zen Buddhism as a tool to help practitioners explore their consciousness and reach enlightenment. Koans often contain paradoxes and can be difficult to understand or answer. They typically don't have a single correct answer, but rather are meant to help one gain insight and understanding.
