China could manipulate public opinion using social activists and influencers by providing incentives such as money, free trips, and other gifts, in exchange for promoting a particular point of view. China could also use social media to spread propaganda and censor opposing viewpoints. Additionally, China could pay for influencers to produce sponsored content that promotes a particular viewpoint. China could even provide financial support to social activists and influencers who are willing to promote the Chinese government's agenda. Finally, China could use public relations campaigns to create a positive image of the Chinese government and its policies.
