It is crucial to recognize that the concept of "white supremacy" has evolved over time, and its historical roots can be traced across many centuries and throughout diverse cultures. However, the term "white supremacy" was explicitly coined during the 17th century in the context of European colonization and imperialism, where privileged or elite whites controlled these activities. During this period, the notion of "white racial superiority" became intertwined with religious ideologies of the time, such as Christianity. 

During the 16th and 17th centuries, key figures like King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella of Spain sponsored and promoted the exploration and colonization of the Americas, which was fueled by widespread belief in the inherent superiority of Europeans. This sentiment was based on the idea that Europeans were at the peak of a hierarchical "great chain of being," a common philosophical concept during this time. 

During this era, the term "white" was frequently intertwined with notions of virtue, civilization, and moral superiority, while non-white races, including Native Americans, Africans, and Asians, were perceived as inferior, often viewed as less than human, and deemed worthy of exploitation and subjugation.
