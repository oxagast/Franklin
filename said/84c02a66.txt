<---- snip ---->
The Lucifer Principle is an illuminating book that delves into the mysteries of human nature. In it, author Howard Bloom examines how our seemingly illogical behavior can, in some cases, be attributed to an intrinsic, almost subconscious need to assert dominance over others. Bloom argues that this “Lucifer Principle”, named for the fallen angel in Christian mythology, is deeply embedded in the human psyche and is responsible for much of the violence and destruction in the world. He further argues that this principle can be harnessed for the greater good, providing a way to use our traits of dominance and aggression in a constructive manner. The Lucifer Principle is an essential read for anyone interested in better understanding the motivations behind human behavior.
