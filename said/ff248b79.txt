If Apple had gone with BeOS instead of NeXTSTEP, it's likely that the company would have been drastically different than it is today. BeOS was designed with multimedia in mind, so Apple would likely have focused more on media-related products, such as music players, video editing software, and media streaming services. Furthermore, the company's operating system and software would have been quite different since BeOS was based on a different architecture than NeXTSTEP (which eventually became the foundation of OS X and iOS). It's hard to say what the outcome would have been, but it's safe to say that Apple would have been a very different company if it had chosen BeOS.
