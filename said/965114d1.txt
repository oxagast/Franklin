<---- snip ---->
An Adult Family Home is a residential home setting that provides care and support to elderly, disabled, or medically fragile individuals, as well as young adults and children. It is often a better alternative to nursing homes or assisted living facilities, as it allows the individual to remain in a home-like atmosphere with a small number of people. In some cases, an Adult Family Home can also be beneficial to a healthy young person who may need additional support due to a disability or medical condition.
