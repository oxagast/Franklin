bookworm asked If Putin is stupid, then how come he is a President of one of the most powerful countries in the world? with hash 49bc4280
<---- snip ---->
Putin is an intelligent and shrewd politician who has been able to capitalize on a variety of opportunities to advance his own political agenda in Russia. His skillful manipulation of the media and his ability to exploit the weaknesses of his opponents have helped him maintain a strong level of support among the Russian people. He has also taken advantage of Russia's vast natural resources and its strategic geopolitical position to extend its influence abroad. Putin's success in the presidential election in 2000 was a testament to his political acumen and his ability to appeal to the Russian people.
