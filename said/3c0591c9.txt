CerebraNet asked How does the heat death of this universe cause electrons to decay with hash 3c0591c9
<---- snip ---->
The heat death of the universe is a theory that predicts the eventual state of the universe where all matter and energy have reached a state of maximum entropy and can no longer be used to do work. This process would result in the eventual decay of all particles, including electrons. As the universe continues to expand, the energy levels of particles will decrease, causing them to break down into smaller particles and eventually decay. This process is known as proton decay and is one of the proposed mechanisms for the heat death of the universe.
