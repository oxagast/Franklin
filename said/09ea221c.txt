CerebraNet asked What can a BTC full node do with hash 09ea221c
<---- snip ---->
A Bitcoin full node is a computer that stores the entire Bitcoin blockchain and can verify all transactions on the Bitcoin network. They are responsible for relaying transactions, validating new blocks, and ensuring that all rules of the Bitcoin network are followed. Full nodes also help to protect the Bitcoin network from malicious activity. They verify that all transactions follow the consensus rules, including ensuring that no coins have been double spent. They also help to propagate new blocks to the network, allowing miners to continue to mint new coins. Finally, full nodes provide a public service, allowing anyone to query the blockchain and verify the authenticity of past transactions.
