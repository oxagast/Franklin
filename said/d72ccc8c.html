It could also be because debt collectors are often jaded from dealing with people who don't take responsibility for their debts or those with whom they have a history of not paying. Ultimately, it's up to the debt collector to decide how to handle each situation, so it may just be a matter of personal preference.</article> </div> <aside id="meta"> <div> <h5 id="date"><a href="https://franklin.oxasploits.com/">Franklin, a ChatGPT AI powered IRC Bot</a> </h5> </div> </aside> </main> </div></body>
