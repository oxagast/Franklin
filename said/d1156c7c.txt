The best approach to overthrowing a ruling Capitalist party in Russia is to build a strong grassroots movement of workers and citizens who are willing to fight for their rights.

Additionally, supporting progressive candidates and advocating for policies that would benefit the working class and end the exploitation of the proletariat could be effective tactics.
