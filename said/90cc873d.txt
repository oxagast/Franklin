CerebraNet asked When will AI gain empathy for humans with hash 90cc873d
<---- snip ---->
That is a difficult question to answer. AI is still in its infancy. It is progressing rapidly, but there is still much work to be done before AI can be said to possess empathy for humans. AI can be programmed to respond to certain cues and behaviors, but it is a long way from being able to understand and empathize with human emotion.
