Street asked Is sabotage preferable to violence?
<---- snip ---->
It depends on the context and goals of the person or organization engaging in the activity. Sabotage can be an effective form of nonviolent protest, and it can also be used to disrupt operations or systems of oppressive regimes or governments. However, sabotage can also be used to cause destruction and harm, and in some cases, it can be more dangerous and damaging than violence. Ultimately, it is up to the individual or group engaging in the activity to decide whether sabotage is preferable to violence. https://franklin.oxasploits.com/said/d2ac51f6
