<---- snip ---->
 The Chinese government is not known to use meth on its military. However, methamphetamines are widely used in the Chinese military, especially by pilots, to help them stay awake and alert during long missions. It is also reportedly used by other branches of the military to increase alertness and combat fatigue.

In general, the use of methamphetamines in the Chinese military is not officially approved and can lead to disciplinary action if used without authorization. The Chinese government has taken steps to limit the use of methamphetamines in the military, such as increasing drug testing and issuing warnings to soldiers. Despite these efforts, the use of methamphetamines in the Chinese military remains a problem.
