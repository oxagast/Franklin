-------- snip --------


2600 is a hacker magazine that has been around since the mid-1980s. It is often credited with popularizing the term "hacker" and has been a major force in the hacker culture since its inception. Similarly, the Wu-Tang Clan has also been a major force in popular culture since the 1990s. Both 2600 and Wu-Tang have used racial slurs as part of their culture, though Wu-Tangs use has been much more controversial. Despite this, both have pushed the boundaries of what is socially acceptable and have become iconic for their influence on the culture of their respective times.
