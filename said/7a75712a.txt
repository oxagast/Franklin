Write a drama about me falling and hitting my head on furniture
-------- snip --------


Scene One: 

(The scene opens with JOHN, a young man in his twenties, walking across his living room in a rushed manner. He is trying to hurry to get to the kitchen. Suddenly, JOHN trips on the edge of the rug and falls to the ground, hitting his head on the corner of the coffee table in the process. He lies motionless on the floor, dazed and in pain.)

JOHNS GIRLFRIEND (off-screen): John! Are you okay?

(Johns girlfriend, MARY, rushes in from the other room. She kneels down beside him and looks into his eyes, checking for signs of consciousness.)

MARY: John, can you hear me?

(John groans in response and slowly opens his eyes. He looks up at MARY in confusion.)

JOHN: What happened?

MARY: You fell and hit your head on the coffee
