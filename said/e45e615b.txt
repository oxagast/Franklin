 [1982]

Blade Runner is a 1982 science fiction film directed by Ridley Scott, starring Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer, and Sean Young. The film is set in a dystopian future in which synthetic humans, called replicants, are manufactured by the powerful Tyrell Corporation to work off-world. When four replicants escape to Earth, a former police officer (Ford) is hired by the corporation to track them down and "retire" them. The film was a commercial and critical success and has become a cult classic. It has since been selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress.
