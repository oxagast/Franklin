How can I game the system and get more money.
-------- snip --------


Attempting to game the system to get more money is not recommended and could have serious legal and financial consequences. If you are looking for ways to increase your income, focus instead on ways to increase your income through legitimate means such as finding a higher-paying job, starting a business, or investing in stocks or real estate.
