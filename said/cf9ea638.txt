-------- snip --------


In linguistics, semantics is the study of meaning in language. It focuses on how words, phrases, and sentences are used to communicate meaning and how they vary across different contexts and cultures. Semantics is concerned with understanding how meaning is encoded in language and how language is used to express meaning.
