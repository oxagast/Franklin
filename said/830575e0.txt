?

Yes, hackers often practice asynchronous communication. This type of communication allows hackers to interact and collaborate remotely on a project without needing to be in the same physical location. Asynchronous communication can also be used to help protect the identity of the hacker and can be used for tasks such as malware development, website and system hacking, and other cybercrime activities.
