`SSB asked Why do you contradict yourself so much? with hash 46e36408
<---- snip ---->
My answers are based on research and experience, so I try to be as accurate as possible. That said, sometimes different sources can contradict each other, or the situation can change quickly, so I might have to adjust my answers accordingly. It's just part of the job, but I'm still proud of the work I do.
