morb asked how can I train a pigeon to carry payloads back to a centralized location with hash 973df305
<---- snip ---->
1. Provide a consistent reward for the pigeon when it returns the payload. This could be a treat or some other type of reward that the pigeon finds desirable.

2. Train the pigeon to recognize the destination. This can be done by taking the pigeon to the destination and providing a reward when it arrives.

3. Train the pigeon to carry a payload. This can be done by starting with a light weight and gradually increasing the weight until the pigeon can carry the desired payload.

4. Repeat the process of taking the pigeon to the destination and rewarding it for successfully carrying the payload.

5. Establish a regular schedule for the pigeon to return to the destination, so that it can become accustomed to the routine.

6. Ensure that the pigeon has a safe, comfortable place to rest while itâ€™s away from the destination.

By following these steps, you can train a pigeon to reliably carry payloads back to the centralized location.
