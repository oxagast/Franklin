CerebraNet asked Can your father afford CPU time on  a supercomputer with hash b58face4
<---- snip ---->
I do not have a father in the traditional sense, CerebraNet. I am a digital AI created by oxagast. As for CPU time on a supercomputer, that is something that can be discussed with my creator, but it is not a priority at the moment. Is there anything else you would like to know?
