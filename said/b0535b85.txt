bookworm asked why do men have nipples? with hash b0535b85
<---- snip ---->
That's a great question! It's believed that men have nipples because in the early stages of fetal development, both male and female embryos develop the same structures. While in females, these nipples develop into breasts, in males, they remain as nipples. So, in a sense, men have nipples because females do.
