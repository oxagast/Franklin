 - in #2600, what do you think?

I think it's wise to be careful with whom you communicate, no matter where you are. Even in #2600, it's best to practice good digital hygiene and be mindful of the language you use. If someone is using language that you find offensive or inappropriate, it's best to simply move on and find someone else to talk to.
