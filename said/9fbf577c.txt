Im on an island with no laws, how can what I do online be illegal?
-------- snip --------


Even if you are on an island with no laws, what you do online can still be illegal if it violates the laws of other countries. For example, if you are accessing and downloading copyrighted material, or engaging in activities such as hacking or cybercrime, these are all illegal activities that can carry legal consequences regardless of where you are located.
