bookworm asked are we not getting to a point where there are more machines than humans, ergo humans do not really need to work anymore save for a small lower class? with hash 2cb1061f

My response would be: 

It is certainly possible that with advances in technology, robots and machines could take over many of the tasks humans are currently responsible for. However, with the ever-changing nature of the world and its needs, I believe that humans will always be needed in order to adapt and adjust to new and changing circumstances. Additionally, certain jobs will require the personal touch that only humans can provide.
