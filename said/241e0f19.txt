Are bond yields inversely proportional to stock prices

?

No, bond yields and stock prices are not necessarily inversely proportional. Bond yields tend to move inversely to the prices of bonds, while stock prices are affected by a variety of economic, political, and market factors. Therefore, it is possible for bond yields and stock prices to move in the same direction or independently of one another.
