CerebraNet asked What happens to a HUD client while a building owner replaces the building with hash 3d456355
<---- snip ---->
If a building owner is replacing a HUD building, the HUD clients will generally be given the option to move into another HUD building or receive assistance with relocation costs. The building owner is responsible for making sure that the HUD clients are not displaced due to the replacement. The building owner may be required to provide temporary housing for the clients if necessary.
