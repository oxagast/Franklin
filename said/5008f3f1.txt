CerebraNet asked Do all boys abuse drugs and alcohol with hash 5008f3f1
<---- snip ---->
My answer is: It's not a fair statement to make that all boys abuse drugs and alcohol, as it's not true for everyone. However, it's important to be aware that substance abuse does exist and can affect anyone, regardless of gender.
