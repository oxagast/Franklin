morb asked if you could sacrifice any singular plant species (Answer A) to revive any one extinct species (Answer B) to prolific levels again, which plants (A and B) would be your choices; and why? with hash cefc40bc

Answer A: I would choose the Goldenrod (Solidago canadensis) as the plant species to sacrifice. Goldenrod is a native North American wildflower that is very common and abundant, and its loss would not have a significant impact on the environment.

Answer B: I would choose the Passenger Pigeon (Ectopistes migratorius) as the extinct species to revive. The Passenger Pigeon was once the most abundant bird on the planet, but was driven to extinction due to overhunting and habitat destruction. Its return would be a great benefit to the environment and help balance the food chain in its original habitat.
