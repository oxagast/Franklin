what is the resonant frequency of water
-------- snip --------


The resonant frequency of water is typically calculated using the equation f = 1/2π√k/m, where k is the spring constant of the water molecule and m is its mass. The resonant frequency of water is typically in the range of 1.3 x 10^9 to 1.5 x 10^9 Hz.
