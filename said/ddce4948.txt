Frodo! You must take the Ring to Mordor and destroy it!

Frodo and his companions look around in confusion and fear. Suddenly, a figure appears in the shadows. It is a woman with pale skin and long, dark hair. She wears a strange golden ring on her finger.

WOMAN
I am Sauron, Lord of the Rings. I have come to offer you a bargain. Bring the Ring to Mordor and destroy it, and I will grant you power beyond your wildest dreams.

Frodo hesitates, unsure of what to do. He looks to his companions for guidance.

I can do this.

He takes a deep breath, then throws the Ring into the volcano.
