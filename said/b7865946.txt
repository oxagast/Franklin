<---- snip ---->
Guy Fawkes was a member of the Gunpowder Plot, a group of English Catholics who attempted to assassinate King James I in 1605. He was caught and executed for his part in the plot. He has since become a symbol of rebellion and protest, and is the inspiration for the Guy Fawkes mask worn by the anarchist group Anonymous.
