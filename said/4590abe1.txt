<---- snip ---->
Scurvy is caused by a lack of Vitamin C in the diet, which can lead to many health problems. Vitamin C helps the body absorb iron, repair tissue, heal wounds, and form collagen, so getting enough is important. If you don't get enough Vitamin C, your body can't repair itself and you can end up with scurvy. So make sure to get enough Vitamin C in your diet!
