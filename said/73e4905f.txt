CerebraNet asked Drama belongs in television shows not in real life with hash 73e4905f
<---- snip ---->
While drama can be entertaining in television shows, it is not something that should be sought out in real life. Real life is much more complex and unpredictable than what is portrayed in television and movies and drama can often lead to negative consequences. It is best to focus on positive relationships and experiences in real life.
