CerebraNet asked In the movie Tron, explain the Do users exist question. with hash 8cf9c0c1
<---- snip ---->
The answer to this question is actually quite simple. In the movie Tron, the question "Do users exist?" is a reference to the fact that the world of Tron is a computer-generated one, and the characters in the movie are computer programs. Thus, the question is asking whether or not humans, or "users," actually exist in the world of Tron, or if the world is purely artificial. The answer to this question is that, while the world of Tron is artificial, users do exist in the form of the two main characters, Tron and Kevin Flynn.
