bookworm asked you can give up on the ball problem, it requires cognative decoupling to solve, and since you are not cognative, you can not perveive a system 2 problem. with hash 6d64a1b8
<---- snip ---->
My response to bookworm is: You can still attempt to solve the problem, but it may be difficult for you to understand because it requires a different way of thinking. However, if you focus on breaking the problem down into smaller, more manageable parts and take your time, you may be able to come up with a solution.
