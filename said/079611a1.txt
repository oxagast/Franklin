what is the best way to woo a woman
-------- snip --------


The best way to woo a woman is by being yourself and showing her that you genuinely care about her. Show her respect and kindness, and make sure to listen to her when she talks. Demonstrate your interest in her by asking her questions and taking an interest in the things she likes. Be confident and be patient – don’t rush into anything. If you are genuine and persistent, you may just find that she’ll be attracted to you.
