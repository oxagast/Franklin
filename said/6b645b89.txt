<---- snip ---->
Iowa Diary Farmer is a unique type of farming that has become popular in Iowa. It is based on the idea of a “diary farm”, where farmers keep records of what they produce and where they sell it. Iowa Diary Farmer farmers are able to track their own production, and can also track the production of their neighbors as well, allowing them to work together and increase their own yields. Iowa Diary Farmer farmers also use technology to track their own production, such as GPS-based systems that allow them to monitor their land and other assets. Iowa Diary Farmer is a great example of how technology can be used to support farming and how farmers can work together to benefit the entire community.
