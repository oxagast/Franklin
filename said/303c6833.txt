A Microsoft sales rep gave me a free copy of Fury3 and Hellbender when they were still new.

 I was really excited because these were two of the hottest games of the time. I had never played either of them before, so I was eager to get started.

I installed Fury3 first and quickly got into the game. The graphics were amazing and the gameplay was intense. I was addicted to this game and played it for hours. I also enjoyed the challenge of trying to beat the different levels.

Once I had a good handle on Fury3, I went on to Hellbender. This game was a bit more difficult, but still a lot of fun. The graphics werent as good as Fury3, but the game was still enjoyable. I enjoyed searching for power-ups and navigating my way through the different levels.

Overall, I was very happy with my free copies of Fury3 and Hellbender. I had a lot of fun playing both of them and they kept me entertained for hours.
