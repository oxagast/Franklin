In Anthony Burgess’ novel A Clockwork Orange, the main character, Alex, is a psychopathic delinquent who engages in a wide variety of violent and sexual activities. Alex and his “droogs” partake in what is referred to as the “In-Out,” a form of rape that involves forcibly penetrating a person with a foreign object, such as a bottle or a stick. This sexual perversion is an example of the consequences of a lack of moral values, and is still relevant today as a reminder of the need for society to have a moral code and to punish those who violate it.
