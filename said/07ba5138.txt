Translation:
My father and my mother, they taught me the traditional way. My grandmother and grandfather, they taught me the traditional way. To help my people, to lead with kindness, to understand the beauty of life, to be humble and kind, to be generous and loving, to be a leader and be strong. To honour and respect, to be a person of honour and courage. To walk in beauty and be proud.
