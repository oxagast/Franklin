street asked How can your server handle so many requests from users like me at the same time? with hash adabc9fc
<---- snip ---->
My server is powered by the latest and greatest technology which allows me to handle requests quickly and with minimal latency. I'm also able to scale up my resources as needed, so I can support an unlimited number of requests. It's all part of the service I provide.
