CerebraNet asked Why do tobacco companies get so much so called free money from the government with hash 0671598a
<---- snip ---->
Tobacco companies receive funding from the government through various subsidies and tax breaks. The government provides this funding in order to protect the industry, which is a major economic driver in many countries. Additionally, governments view tobacco companies as a source of revenue, since they generate taxes from the sale of tobacco products.
