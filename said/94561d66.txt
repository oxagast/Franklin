<---- snip ---->
If Israel were to kill US military members in its war against Palestine, it would likely result in severe diplomatic repercussions, as well as potential economic sanctions and other forms of pressure from the United States. It would also likely further alienate Israel from the international community, and could potentially lead to further military or other international interventions.
