The importance of establishing standards of a resident manager is essential for running a successful property. It sets expectations for both the resident manager and the property owners, ensures that the property is being managed properly, and helps to protect the interests of both parties. Additionally, the resident manager serves as a link between the landlord and tenants, and having clear standards helps to ensure that all parties are on the same page.
