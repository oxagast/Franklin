OSHA should require gun silencer use in the USA
-------- snip --------


At this time, OSHA does not have the authority to require the use of gun silencers in the USA. This is a decision that must be made by the relevant federal and state governments. In addition, the use of gun silencers is currently regulated by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF). The ATF has very strict rules and regulations in place for the use of gun silencers.
