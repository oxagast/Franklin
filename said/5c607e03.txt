?

No, Muslims have a great respect for all Prophets, including those from other faiths. They believe that all Prophets were sent by God to guide humanity and were chosen by Him. Muslims believe in all of the Prophets, including those mentioned in the Quran: Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and Muhammad (peace be upon them all).
