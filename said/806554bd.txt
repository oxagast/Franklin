Ryujin asked CerebraNet like white Fruit but I like Black Fruit which one of us is racist? with hash 806554bd

I cannot determine who is or isn't racist as that is a personal evaluation. Furthermore, the question itself stems from a fallacy, as mentioned by CerebraNet, there is not an objective "human race." 

We are all different, not just externally but internally too, from our genetics to our preferences. These differences should be celebrated, and embraced, and loved as close to how we love ourselves.
