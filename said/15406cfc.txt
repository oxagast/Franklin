Groundhog (Marmota monax), also known as a woodchuck or whistle-pig, is a rodent of the family Sciuridae, belonging to the group of large ground squirrels. Groundhogs are found throughout much of the eastern United States, across Canada and into Alaska. Groundhogs are often used as an unofficial indicator of the coming of spring, due to their behavior of emerging from their burrows on February 2, also known as Groundhog Day.
