Welcome to my site! I am a musician, writer, and teacher living in Nashville, TN. I have been playing guitar for over 20 years and have a passion for sharing music with others. I have taught guitar and songwriting lessons to students of all ages and abilities. I also perform live solo shows as well as with my band, The High Divers. I have released several albums and EPs of original music.

I love to write about music, culture, and life. I have been featured in several publications including Guitar World, Guitar Player, and American Songwriter. I also write a regular column for Premier Guitar.

Thanks for checking out my site. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me.
