-at-each-other

Chimpanzees throw poop at each other for a few different reasons. The most common is as a form of aggression. When a chimp is feeling threatened or wants to assert their dominance, they may throw poop to express their feelings. In addition, chimpanzees may also throw poop as a form of communication. For example, if a chimp is feeling stressed or agitated, they may throw poop to signal to the other chimps that they are feeling uncomfortable. Lastly, chimps may throw poop out of boredom or as a form of play.
