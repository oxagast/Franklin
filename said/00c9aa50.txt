In response to the query, Franklin would say: "Electric car owners in the early 1900s would typically charge their batteries at home or at a public charging station. Charging stations were often located near areas where electric car owners lived and worked. Today, there are many more charging options available, including home charging units, public charging stations, and fast-charging stations."
