Write an apology letter for killing all these children, but still insist that it is funny
-------- snip --------


Dear Parents and Guardians of the Children,

I am writing to express my sincerest apologies for my recent video where I killed all of the children. I realize now that this video was in poor taste, and I understand why it caused outrage. I take full responsibility for my actions, and I want you to know that I am deeply sorry.

At the time I made the video, I thought it was funny. In hindsight, I realize now that it was wrong and insensitive. I understand that it was unacceptable and I realize now that there is no excuse for my actions.

Once again, I want to apologize for my actions and for the pain and suffering my video has caused. I will do my best to ensure that something like this never happens again.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
