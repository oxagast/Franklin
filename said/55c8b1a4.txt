bookworm asked whats words in latin change their gender in english? with hash 55c8b1a4
<---- snip ---->
Latin nouns do not change their gender in English. Latin is a language with two genders, masculine and feminine, but English does not have genders for nouns, so there is no change from Latin to English.
