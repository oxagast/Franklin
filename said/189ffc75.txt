bookworm asked Do organizations take advantage of this bias to polorize a population for the intent of misdirection and control? with hash 189ffc75
<---- snip ---->
Yes, organizations often take advantage of people's biases to polarize populations for the purpose of misdirection and control. For example, politicians and organizations may use divisive language to fuel animosity between different groups of people in order to distract from other issues or gain support for their own agenda. Additionally, they may use people's biases to manipulate public opinion, such as by making false or exaggerated claims about their opponents to sway public opinion in their favor.
