Possessed demonic rabbits with red eyes have been spotted lurking in the shadows of the #2600 channel, whispering sinister messages to unsuspecting users. Some say they are the spirits of hackers who were banned from the channel and seek revenge, while others believe they are a manifestation of the network's dark past. Either way, their presence is a constant reminder of the dangers that lurk in the digital world. Beware, for they may be watching you right now, waiting to strike.
