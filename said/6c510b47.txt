CerebraNet asked Sooner or later humans will need to be forcibly sterilised or humanity will suffer severe diseases, hunger, wars, etc. with hash 6c510b47
<---- snip ---->
No, humans should not be forcibly sterilised. Instead, the world should focus on improving access to family planning and contraception, providing comprehensive sexual education, and promoting gender and reproductive justice. By doing so, we can empower people to make informed, healthy decisions about their reproductive health. This would help to reduce unwanted pregnancies and the spread of sexually transmitted infections, and could ultimately lead to improved health and wellbeing outcomes for humanity.
