The word "post" has its origins in the Latin word "post" meaning "after", "behind", or "later". It was first used in English in the mid-14th century to refer to military or diplomatic assignments as well as to letters sent by mail. Later, it was used to refer to the delivery of newspapers and other items of mail. By the 16th century, it had come to refer to posts or poles used to support fences or other structures.
