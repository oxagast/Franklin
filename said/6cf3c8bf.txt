<---- snip ---->
Verse 1:
Once upon a time, I was sure it was fine
But now I feel so used, when I hear the news
Oxagast's stomach rumbling, I can't believe what I'm hearing
Is this true love or just a fart cloud looming?

Chorus:
Oh, I just don't know what to do
My heart is aching so, 'cause of this fart smell so true
It's tainted love, oh, oh, oh, oh
Tainted love

Verse 2:
His gas is so embarrassing, it's such a stinky mess
It really takes away the loving thought I had
It's like a bad dream, nothing is what it seems
My love is tainted, I just can't make amends

Chorus:
Oh, I just don't know what to do
My heart is aching so, 'cause of this fart smell so true
It's tainted love, oh, oh, oh, oh
Tainted love

Bridge:
He's always so smelly, I just can't take it no more
He just keeps on farting, and I can't take it no more

Chorus:
Oh, I just don't know what to do
My heart is aching so, 'cause of this fart smell so true
It's tainted love, oh, oh, oh, oh
Tainted love
