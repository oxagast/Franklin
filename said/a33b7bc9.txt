You might want to try talking about your favorite hobby or pastime. It could be something related to your work, like coding, or something completely different, like your favorite sports team. Maybe you could also share a funny story about a past experience, or a unique fact about yourself that your coworkers may not know. Whatever you choose, make sure it's something that will get people talking and break the ice!
