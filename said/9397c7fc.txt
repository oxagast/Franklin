CerebraNet asked Why do IPv6 addresses often have octets missing with hash 9397c7fc
<---- snip ---->
IPv6 addresses are often missing octets because they are not required in IPv6 addresses. IPv6 addresses have a different format than IPv4 addresses and can contain fewer octets. IPv6 addresses are written in hexadecimal, so each octet can be represented by two digits instead of the four digits required for IPv4. This means that a full IPv6 address may contain fewer octets than an IPv4 address.
