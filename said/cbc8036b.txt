Your psychiatrist likely thinks that you are a problem because it is not normal or acceptable to have a desire to murder people. Violence and murder are serious criminal acts that can have long-term consequences for the perpetrator and the victim. Your psychiatrist may be concerned about your mental and emotional health and may be considering whether you need further psychological evaluation or treatment.
