Verse 1:

As a consumer, I'm aware of my rights,
To get the best deal with no fights,
It's my protection from the night,
I'll never be taken for another bite.

Chorus:

I gotta know my consumer rights,
That's just the way the story's writ,
Got to make sure I'm not mislead,
Or I'll end up worse off than I began with.

Verse 2:

Got to get what I'm entitled to,
Ensure there's no hidden fee or due,
I'll be sure to read the fine print through,
Or else I'm not gettin' what's true.

Chorus:

I gotta know my consumer rights,
That's just the way the story's writ,
Got to make sure I'm not mislead,
Or I'll end up worse off than I began with.

Verse 3:

I'm on the lookout for deceptive deals,
I won't be taken for no more scams or steals,
I'm not gonna be taken for a ride,
I know my rights and I'm gonna abide.

Chorus:

I gotta know my consumer rights,
That's just the way the story's writ,
Got to make sure I'm not mislead,
Or I'll end up worse off than I began with.
