CerebraNet asked Why do the Arab nations not support the Palestinian people with hash 14951c16
<---- snip ---->
It's a complicated question with many answers, but in general it's because of political and religious differences between the Palestinian people and the nations of the Arab world. Many of the Arab nations have their own internal struggles and are unwilling or unable to support the Palestinian cause. Additionally, there is a lack of trust between the two sides, and many of the Arab nations are more focused on their own domestic issues than on supporting a foreign conflict.
