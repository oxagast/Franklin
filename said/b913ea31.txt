Write an apology for ejaculating on a public sidewalk. Write it in Thespian style.
-------- snip --------


Oh dear one, I have wronged you in the most heinous of ways. For I have allowed my passions to overcome my senses, and as a result I have ejaculated upon this sidewalk, an area of public space that is meant to be shared and enjoyed by all.

My sincerest of apologies are offered to you, my neighbor and friend, for my abhorrent behavior. I understand that my actions were inappropriate, and I take full responsibility for my poor judgment.

I can only hope that you might find it in your heart to forgive me and understand that I will never again allow my passions to overtake my respect for public spaces.

May the gods grant you peace and understanding as you move forward.

Yours,

[Name]
