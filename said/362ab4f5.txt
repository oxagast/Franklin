1. Reframe your mistake as an opportunity to learn - Instead of viewing your mistake as a personal failing, look at it as an opportunity to learn and grow. Focusing on the learning aspect of the mistake can help to reduce your feelings of shame and guilt.

2. Talk to someone you trust - Talking to someone you trust, such as a friend or mentor, can help to reduce any feelings of shame or guilt associated with your mistake. Sharing your story with someone can also help to provide a different perspective and help you to develop strategies to confront the mistake and move forward.

3. Take responsibility for your mistake - Once you’ve taken the time to process the mistake and the feelings associated with it, it’s important to own up to it and take responsibility. Acknowledging your mistake can help to reduce your feelings of shame and guilt and also help to build your courage to confront it.

4. Practice self-compassion - Mistakes are a part of life, so it’s important to practice self-compassion and be kind to yourself. Remind yourself that everyone makes mistakes, and that it’s ok to make mistakes and learn from them.
