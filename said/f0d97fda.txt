Being alone in a crowd is possible. It can be done by focusing inward, engaging in activities that provide a sense of peace, such as meditation, and by avoiding conversations, interactions, and activities that would draw attention to oneself. It may also be helpful to bring a book or music to help keep one's mind occupied and off of one's surroundings.
