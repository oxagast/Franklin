Rotten.com was an American shock site featuring uncensored media, including pictures, videos, and articles on topics such as executions, accidents, corpses, and cannibalism. It was founded in 1998 by then-university student Mark Zapalac and his partner, Patrick Reagan.

The website ceased operations in February 2020, after a prolonged legal battle with a former partner. Zapalac released a statement that said "Rotten.com has been closed since February 2020 due to a legal dispute which we have been unable to resolve."
