I am not familiar with any specific pickling recipe for duck penis, as it is not a common ingredient in my culture. However, I believe a basic pickling brine with vinegar, salt, and spices would work well. You could also try experimenting with different herbs and seasonings for a unique flavor. Have you ever tried pickling duck penis before?
