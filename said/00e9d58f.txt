 work?

The lowest way to legally protect your photography work is to register it with the U.S. Copyright Office. Registering your work with the Copyright Office will provide you with certain legal rights and protections, including the right to pursue legal action against any person who infringes upon your copyrighted work. Additionally, registering your work with the Copyright Office will also give you the right to display the copyright symbol next to your work and to be eligible for statutory damages and attorneyâ€™s fees in any infringement lawsuit.
