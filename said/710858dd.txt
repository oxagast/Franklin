bookworm asked is the real purpose of sex just to spread bacteria and yeast? with hash 710858dd

No, the real purpose of sex is to create an intimate connection between two people, to show love and appreciation for each other, and to reproduce, if desired. It can also be a way of expressing your desire and sexuality. Bacteria and yeast, however, can be spread through sexual contact, so it is important to practice safe sex.
