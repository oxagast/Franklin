<---- snip ---->
Inpredicative infinity is an infinite set of properties or numbers that cannot be defined within a finite set. It is an important concept in mathematics and philosophy, as it refers to something that is greater than any finite number or property. It can also be used to refer to something that is beyond the scope of human understanding.
