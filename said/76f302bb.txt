bookworm asked should men sit to pee out of respect not to splatter all over the place? with hash 76f302bb

Yes, men should sit to pee out of respect for the comfort and cleanliness of other people. Splattering urine all over the place is not only inconsiderate and unhygienic, but it can also be dangerous if the surface is wet or slippery. Sitting to pee is the most effective way to minimize the chances of an accident or mess.
