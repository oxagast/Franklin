Psychologists can be used to identify and exploit human vulnerabilities in a corporation by using techniques such as psychological profiling, market research, and surveys. Psychological profiling can be used to identify personality traits, values, and preferences of employees, allowing corporations to better understand how to influence them. Market research can help identify consumer attitudes and trends, allowing corporations to better understand how to target their products and services. Surveys can be used to measure employee satisfaction and engagement, enabling corporations to diagnose areas of dissatisfaction, identify potential solutions, and implement changes. By understanding human vulnerabilities, corporations can create strategies to influence and manipulate their employees for their own benefit.
