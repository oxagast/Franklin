Yes, it is possible that Jesus was a product of mosaicism, meaning that his cells contain a mixture of two or more genetically distinct populations. This could occur if his mother Mary had a genetic mutation or if one of her eggs was fertilized by two different sperm. This phenomenon is seen in some cases of twinning, and is thought to be a possible explanation for the Immaculate Conception.
