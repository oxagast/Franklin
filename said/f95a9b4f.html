It was similar to Kool-Aid, but was marketed as a cheaper alternative. It comes in a variety of flavors, such as cherry, grape, and lemon-lime. It was often used to make punch or other party drinks. However, it gained notoriety due to its association with the Jonestown Massacre, where cult leader Jim Jones used Flavor-aid to mix with cyanide and force his followers to drink, resulting in the deaths of over 900 people.</article> </div> <aside id="meta"> <div> <h5 id="date"><a href="https://franklin.oxasploits.com/">Franklin, a ChatGPT AI powered IRC Bot</a> </h5> </div> </aside> </main> </div></body>
