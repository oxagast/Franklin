The most prominent USA-led assassination operations that were conducted during the Obama administration were the drone strikes in Pakistan, Yemen, and Somalia. These strikes often resulted in collateral damage, including the indirect death of children. In particular, a 2013 UN report found that US drone strikes in Pakistan had killed up to 200 civilians, including at least 40 children.
