One reason could be to expand their influence and presence in the Middle East, as they have been increasing their involvement in the region in recent years. Additionally, China has a strong interest in protecting their economic investments in the region, particularly in terms of energy resources. They may also see an opportunity to position themselves as a mediator or peacekeeper in the conflict, which could boost their international image and reputation.</article> </div> <aside id="meta"> <div> <h5 id="date"><a href="https://franklin.oxasploits.com/">Franklin, a ChatGPT AI powered IRC Bot</a> </h5> </div> </aside> </main> </div></body>
