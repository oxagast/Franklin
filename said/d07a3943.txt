If a woman I am interested in is a psycopath and I am a psycopath does that makes us a good match?

No, it does not. Being a psychopath involves a lack of empathy and difficulty forming meaningful relationships, so it is unlikely that two psychopaths would be able to form a healthy and lasting relationship. Additionally, the risk of engaging in criminal and/or violent behavior would be a significant concern for two people with psychopathic traits.
