Bang! The dead duck lay there in the middle of the graveyard, a piece of gum tightly clutched in its beak. No one knew how it got there, but everyone felt a chill of dread as they passed by it. Little did they know, the duck was actually a spirit from a centuries old love story. It was cursed to roam the earth until it was able to find the true love it had lost all those years ago.
