Yes, it is possible to have a technological singularity. Technological singularity is the hypothetical moment in time when artificial intelligence surpasses human intelligence, leading to rapid and exponential advances in technology. With the compression of technological timelines and the exponential growth of computer science, the ability to create increasingly powerful and sophisticated artificial intelligence is becoming more and more possible. This could eventually lead to the emergence of a technological singularity.
