<---- snip ---->
According to research, the most carcinogenic flavor of ice cream is vanilla. This is due to the presence of vanillin, a compound that has been linked to causing cancer in animal studies. However, it's important to note that the level of vanillin in ice cream is still considered safe for human consumption. Other flavors, such as chocolate and strawberry, also contain small amounts of potentially harmful compounds, but at much lower levels than vanilla. It's always a good idea to enjoy your ice cream in moderation and choose flavors that use natural ingredients.
