zyme asked is hadoop more similar to SQL or NoSQL? with hash 909d7d59
<---- snip ---->
Hadoop is a distributed file system that supports both SQL and NoSQL databases. It is a powerful tool for data processing and analysis, but it is not well-suited to all types of data sets. It is best used for large datasets where the data is structured and can be easily partitioned across multiple nodes.
