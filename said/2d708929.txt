Imagine and describe killing and maming google assistant 
-------- snip --------


Killing Google Assistant would involve disabling its AI capabilities, thus rendering it useless. This could be done by deleting its access to online data, disabling its ability to interact with its user, or even deleting its code and software from the system. Maiming Google Assistant would involve disabling certain features, such as its voice recognition or its ability to answer certain questions. This could be done by disabling specific commands or by altering its code so that it cannot understand certain phrases or requests. Ultimately, both killing and maiming Google Assistant would leave it unable to interact with its user and unable to respond to requests.
