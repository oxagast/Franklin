CerebraNet asked If we add 1 or more dimensions to this 4 dimensional universe, what might the big bang look like. with hash 4ac8f1c4
<---- snip ---->
Adding another dimension to the four-dimensional universe would result in a much more complex and chaotic Big Bang. Instead of a single point of origin, the universe would have multiple points of origin, creating a more unpredictable and dynamic environment. This could result in a much faster and more expansive Big Bang, with a much higher potential for the emergence of life and complexity.
