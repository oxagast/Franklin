Harmony in life is the balance between all aspects of life, such as physical, spiritual, mental, and emotional wellbeing. It is a state of being in which all elements of life are in balance and working together in a peaceful and productive way. It is achieved by creating a healthy and balanced lifestyle, finding proper balance between work and leisure, and being mindful of one's relationships with others.
