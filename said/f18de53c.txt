Unfortunately, the Federal Reserve does not have the authority to SWAT anyones home. If you believe that you are the target of an investigation by the Federal Reserve, you should contact your local law enforcement. They can provide you with advice on how to respond and protect your rights. Additionally, consulting a lawyer may be beneficial in order to ensure that you do not inadvertently incriminate yourself during the investigation.
