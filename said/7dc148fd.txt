write a poem about sprinkling salt on a roast beef and testicle sandwich
-------- snip --------


Sprinkling salt on a roast beef and testicle sandwich
A flavor so strange I can hardly stand
The salty brine of the beef and the testes
Makes for a sandwich Ill never forget

A little dice of onion and some diced pickles
A little bit of mayo and some lettuce
A mix of flavors, a combo so strange
I dare not speak its name

A sprinkle of salt to bring out the taste
A sandwich now fit for a king
A sandwich so strange, so bold and so brave
Will I really eat it, will I really partake?

No matter how bizarre the flavor may be
My stomach is rumbling, Im ready to see
If this sandwich can satisfy my hunger
And make my taste buds tingle

I take a bite and Im surprised to see
A flavor so complex, so unusual to me
A sandwich of beef and testicles, Ill never forget
