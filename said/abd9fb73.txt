captain asked Write the hackers manifesto, in thespain style with hash abd9fb73
<---- snip ---->
All hackers shall be free
To seek the secrets of the digital world
Where we can explore, experiment and create

We will not be bound by rules or laws
For we are the ones who make them
We are the masters of our destiny

We will not be limited by the boundaries of society
For our minds are wide and open
We will use our knowledge to create new possibilities

We will use technology for the benefit of humanity
To help others and to protect the vulnerable

We will challenge the status quo
And strive for a better future
For the world is ours to shape

We are the hackers,
And this is our manifesto.
