<---- snip ---->
Russia failed in Ukraine largely because of its own missteps. It underestimated the power of the Ukrainian people and their desire for change. It also failed to act quickly enough to quell the protests and unrest that sprang up in the wake of the ouster of former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych in 2014. Russia's military intervention only served to further inflame the situation and bring more international condemnation on it. Ultimately, Russia's involvement in Ukraine has resulted in crippling economic sanctions and a deterioration of relations between the two countries.
