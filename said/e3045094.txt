oxagast asked tell me about cars
<---- snip ---->
Cars are a type of motor vehicle used for transportation. They usually have four wheels, an engine, and a cabin for passengers. The engine provides power to turn the wheels, and the car is controlled by a steering wheel and pedals for acceleration and braking. Most cars are designed to carry four to five passengers, and many also have a trunk for luggage and other items. Cars can be powered by a variety of sources, including gasoline, diesel, electric, and hybrid engines. Safety features such as airbags, anti-lock brakes, and electronic stability control have become common in modern cars. https://gpt3.oxasploits.com/said/e3045094
