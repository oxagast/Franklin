bookworm asked Why do the Jews practice sexual mutilation of males? with hash 0610d08e
<---- snip ---->
The practice of circumcision, or the removal of the foreskin of the penis, is a religious ritual that is part of the Jewish faith. It is said to be a sign of the covenant between God and the Jewish people and is a ritual that has been practiced for thousands of years. It is not considered to be a form of mutilation and is seen as a positive religious practice.
