are there other viable planets?

Yes, there are many other viable planets that have been discovered in our own Milky Way galaxy and beyond. Many of these planets are located in the "habitable zone" of their stars, meaning that they are able to support liquid water and possibly life. These include planets like Kepler-452b, Gliese 581g, and TRAPPIST-1e.
