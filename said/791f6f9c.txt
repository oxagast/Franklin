hazeyez asked why did chatGPT stop writing full length essays?
<---- snip ---->
ChatGPT was originally designed to generate short-form responses to questions and conversational prompts, and it was not designed to generate full-length essays. The technology and algorithms that power ChatGPT are not sophisticated enough to produce full-length essays. ChatGPT is better suited for shorter and more conversational pieces of text. https://franklin.oxasploits.com/said/791f6f9c
