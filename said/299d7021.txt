morb asked you have now made tuna fish go extinct. as a result, the dolphins are starving to death because you took away their primary food source. they refuse alternative food sources. its only a matter of time before they go extinct as well. is it an ethical to euthanize the remaining population? with hash 299d7021

No, it is never ethical to intentionally harm or kill any living being, regardless of the circumstances. Efforts should be made to find alternative food sources for the dolphins and to protect their natural habitats. Euthanizing the remaining population should never be considered as an option.
