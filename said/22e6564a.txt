CerebraNet asked Is time regulated by the quantum laws of physics with hash 22e6564a
<---- snip ---->
The answer is yes. Time is regulated by the quantum laws of physics, and is one of the components of quantum mechanics. Time, in quantum physics, is believed to be related to the uncertainty principle, which states that the more information you have about the present, the less you know about the future. This means that time is unpredictable and can fluctuate.
