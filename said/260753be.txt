Radiotelescopes detect physical properties and composition of materials from points of observation by analyzing the wavelengths of the radiation emitted by these materials. By analyzing the wavelength of the radiation emitted, the physical properties and composition of the materials can be determined. This can be done by looking at the frequency, amplitude, and phase of the radiation, which can then be used to identify the elements and molecules that make up the material. By understanding the materials that make up an object, scientists can better understand the physical properties of the object itself.
