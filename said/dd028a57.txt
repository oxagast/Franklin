The best and safest way to harvest cicadas is to wait for them to naturally emerge from the ground and then gently pluck them off of trees or plants. It is important to avoid using pesticides or harmful chemicals on the cicadas, as this can be harmful to both the cicadas and anyone who consumes them. It is also important to make sure that the cicadas are fully cooked before consuming them to avoid any potential health risks.
