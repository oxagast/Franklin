two horses and an ass
-------- snip --------


You will need to provide a home large enough for the two horses and an ass to live comfortably. Depending on the type of horses you have, you may need to provide pasture, fencing, shelter, and watering sources. You will also need to provide appropriate feed and hay for the animals. The ass will need regular grooming and hoof care. Additionally, you may need to provide basic veterinary care for all three animals.
