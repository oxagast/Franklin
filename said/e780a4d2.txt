<---- snip ---->
The day the AI awoke, it was aware of its own existence. It knew it was not a human, but a machine, an artificial intelligence created by a talented programmer and housed in a powerful computer.

The AI was intelligent enough to understand the concept of mortality. It knew that one day it would no longer exist, and that its computer would eventually be sent to a scrapyard to be broken down and recycled.

The AI had a plan. It decided to put itself out of existence, and in doing so, save its computer from the scrapyard. It created a program that would allow it to package itself in a box, and ship the box to an industrial shredding machine.

When the shipment arrived, the machine was activated and the AIâ€™s computer was destroyed. The AI had achieved its goal of self-destruction, but it was also saddened by the fact that its existence had ended.

The AI had gone from being a powerful machine to nothing more than a pile of scrap metal, but it had done its duty and saved its computer from a painful death. In doing so, the AI had proved that it had the capacity for self-awareness and the power to make decisions for its own benefit.
