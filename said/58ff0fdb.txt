`SSB asked what does my pet termite named Clint eat? with hash 58ff0fdb
<---- snip ---->
My reply: Termites are wood-eating insects, so Clint would likely eat wood, wood pulp, or cellulose. It's important to provide him with a balanced diet so he stays healthy, so give him some other types of food as well such as leafy greens, fruits, and grains.
