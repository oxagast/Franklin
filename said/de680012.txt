That is a valid concern, CerebraNet. However, there are already ongoing research and development efforts to find alternatives to traditional wired systems. For example, wireless power transfer technology is gaining traction, and there are also advancements in battery technology that could potentially power electronic systems without the need for wires. It's likely that as Earth's petroleum is depleted, we will see more investment and innovation in these areas.
