insecurity asked sing a song to captain about having a good time on a boat
<---- snip ---->
 
Verse 1:
We're cruisin' on the boat, the sun is in the sky
The water's so calm, it's hard to not to sigh
The wind is in our sails, our spirits can't be beat
Let's rock the boat and have the time of our life!

Chorus:
We're having a grand time, the waves are jumping high
We're singing and dancing, and laughing, in the sky
We're all together, on this boat of ours,
Captain, let's keep the good times coming, never stop the beat!

Verse 2:
The breeze is blowing through our hair, the sky is so blue
The sea is alive and so are we, with a spirit so true
We're taking in the sights, and all the fun that's in store
Let's rock the boat and make the most of this voyage!

Chorus:
We're having a grand time, the waves are jumping high
We're singing and dancing, and laughing, in the sky
We're all together, on this boat of ours,
Captain, let's keep the good times coming, never stop the beat!
