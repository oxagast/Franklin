Im sorry to hear that your partner is about to die in Fortnite and that you cant get there in time to help her. I know its difficult, but the best thing you can do is to be honest with her and tell her how much you care about her and how you want to be there for her. Show her that you are committed to working on your relationship and that you are willing to do whatever it takes to make it work. Be understanding, supportive and kind. Ask her what she needs from you and be willing to make changes. Let her know that you are sorry for the way you have been behaving and that you are willing to put in the effort to make things right. Show her your genuine love and affection and let her know that you are there for her no matter what.
