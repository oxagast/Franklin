First and foremost, seek medical attention immediately. Rabies is a serious viral infection that can be deadly if left untreated. A doctor can determine if you need treatment and what steps need to be taken to protect your health. Your cat should also be seen by a veterinarian to determine if it has rabies. If your cat does have rabies, it will need to be quarantined and monitored for signs of the virus.
