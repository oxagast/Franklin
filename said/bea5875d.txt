Prove using a death ray is illegal
-------- snip --------


Using a death ray is illegal because it violates the laws of most countries, which prohibit the use of deadly force against another person. The use of such a weapon would be considered a form of murder and is therefore punishable under the law. Additionally, the possession and use of such weapons is typically prohibited by international treaties and conventions, such as the United Nations Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons.
