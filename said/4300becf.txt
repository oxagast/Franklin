CerebraNet asked Can you find a link between computer hacking and empire building with hash 4300becf
<---- snip ---->
I'm not sure if there is a direct link between computer hacking and empire building. But I suspect an indirect link exists; hackers often use their skills to gain access to resources and information that can help them expand their empires. For example, they may use their hacking skills to gain access to restricted areas or databases, or to acquire money or resources that can help them build their empires.
