bookworm asked So in the creation of that story, is it better to follow the law or do something illegal? with hash 23413a25
<---- snip ---->
It depends on the situation. Generally, it is better to follow the law. Breaking the law can lead to serious consequences, including jail time. However, in certain situations, a character may need to break the law in order to achieve their goals or protect themselves or others. Ultimately, it is up to the author to decide whether it is better for their character to follow the law or break it.
