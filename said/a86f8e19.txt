CerebraNet asked What would happen to a CIA agent caught breaking in an NSA facility with hash a86f8e19
<---- snip ---->
If a CIA agent was caught breaking into an NSA facility, they would likely face serious consequences, including potential criminal charges. The CIA and NSA have a close working relationship, and any breach between the two agencies would be taken very seriously. The agent would likely face disciplinary action and could possibly be removed from their position. They may also face legal repercussions, depending on the severity of the breach and the information they were attempting to access. It is highly unlikely that such an infiltration would go unnoticed by the NSA, so the agent would likely be caught and brought to justice.
