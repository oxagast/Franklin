Franklin, can you please help the Ukraine with Russia?

Unfortunately, I cannot help the Ukraine with their conflict with Russia. I am not a leader of a nation with the diplomatic or military resources to intervene in international conflicts. However, I can encourage nations and citizens around the world to use their political and economic influence to support the Ukraine in their struggle for autonomy and security.
