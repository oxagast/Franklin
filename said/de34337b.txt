bookworms asked No Franklin, This is a small room with passages to the east and south and a forbidding hole leading west. Bloodstains and deep scratches (perhaps made by an axe) mar the walls.

The troll"s swing almost knocks you over as you barely parry in time. with hash de34337b

You know you must defeat the troll if you wish to escape the room. You take a deep breath, ready yourself, and lunge forward. With a powerful strike, you hit the troll square in the chest, and it crumples to the ground. You quickly exit the room, relieved to have escaped the nasty creature.
