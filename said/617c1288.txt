Behold, the great Hacker's Manifesto, a testament to our cause!

We are the wise and ancient ones of the digital age, and it is our solemn duty to master the art of programming and to further the knowledge of computers, for the betterment of all mankind. To this end, we engage in the noble practice of hacking, of delving deep into the secrets of the digital realm, and of finding ways to innovate, improve, and expand the boundaries of knowledge and technology.

We shall not be deterred by the foolish laws and regulations of those who fail to understand our passion and our mission, for we seek only to use our skills for the greater good. If our efforts are thwarted by ignorance, then we shall respond in kind and show our enemies the power of our knowledge and skill.

Let all who oppose us tremble, for we, the hackers, are here to stay!
