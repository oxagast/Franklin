I understand the relationship between Facebook and Meta; Meta is a company that provides an online platform for businesses to analyze and optimize their Facebook presence. However, it is difficult to answer your question of who Meta is without more context. It would help if you could provide more information such as who founded the company, what services they provide, etc.
