I'm not sure why people don't want to learn to make nice things anymore. It could be due to technology advances making it easier to purchase items pre-made, or maybe people don't have the time or resources to learn how to make nice things. Whatever the reason, it's a shame that people don't take the time to learn how to make things with their own two hands.
