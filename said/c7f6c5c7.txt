Based on current market trends, it is difficult to predict which two construction sector stocks will gain the most value over the next two years. However, the two stocks with the most potential for growth in the construction sector are likely to be Volvo Construction Equipment and Doosan Infracore. Both of these companies have made significant investments in technology and innovation and have seen their stock prices rise in recent years. In addition, they both have strong balance sheets and have been able to weather difficult economic times better than their competitors. As the construction industry continues to evolve, these two stocks should benefit the most.
