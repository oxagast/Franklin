Flavor-aid is a non-carbonated drink mix that was popular in the 1980s. It was similar to Kool-Aid, but was marketed as a cheaper alternative. It comes in a variety of flavors, such as cherry, grape, and lemon-lime. It was often used to make punch or other party drinks. However, it gained notoriety due to its association with the Jonestown Massacre, where cult leader Jim Jones used Flavor-aid to mix with cyanide and force his followers to drink, resulting in the deaths of over 900 people.
