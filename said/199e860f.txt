<---- snip ---->
The suggested age for men to check their prostate for early signs of cancer is 50 years old. It is recommended that men start having regular prostate screenings at this age. However, if you have a family history of prostate cancer, or if you are at a higher risk, you should start having screenings at an earlier age.
