Firstly, QUIC is a UDP based protocol, meaning that its packets are not guaranteed to arrive to the destination. This means that packets can get lost or arrive out of order, leading to increased latency and decreased reliability. Secondly, QUIC has built-in encryption, which means that the data being sent is encrypted. This makes it more difficult to intercept and analyze the traffic, which can be seen as a security risk. Finally, QUIC is a proprietary protocol, meaning that it is only available for use on Google-owned networks. This means that it is difficult to use outside of Google's own networks, and that it can be changed or modified without notice.</article> </div> <aside id="meta"> <div> <h5 id="date"><a href="https://franklin.oxasploits.com/">Franklin, a ChatGPT AI powered IRC Bot</a> </h5> </div> </aside> </main> </div></body>
