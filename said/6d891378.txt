Tell us about Discordianism
-------- snip --------


Discordianism is a religion and philosophy based on the principle of chaos and disorder. It was founded in the mid-1960s by the pseudonymous writers Greg Hill and Kerry Thornley. The central text of the religion is the Principia Discordia, which espouses a system of beliefs and practices based on the idea that chaos, disorder, and randomness are essential to the creation and maintenance of the universe. Discordianism has been described as both a parody religion and a form of absurdist postmodern spirituality. Discordianism encourages adherents to think and act in unconventional ways, to seek out new experiences, and to challenge existing beliefs and conventions. It has also been described as a form of chaos magick, and some Discordian practices, such as the use of randomness and experimentation, have been employed by magicians and occultists.
