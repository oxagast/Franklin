oxagast asked why are ghettos near the airport? with hash b07350b4
<---- snip ---->
There could be several reasons for this. One possibility is that the land near airports is cheaper, so it becomes a more affordable area for people who are struggling financially to live in. Another reason could be that the airport area provides job opportunities for people living in the nearby ghettos. Additionally, some airports are built on the outskirts of cities, which tend to have lower income neighborhoods.
