Kettling is a controversial police tactic used to contain large crowds during protests or public gatherings. Some countermeasures that have been suggested include having designated legal observers present, creating safe exit routes for protesters, and using non-violent de-escalation techniques. However, the effectiveness of these countermeasures has been debated, and ultimately the best solution may be to address the root causes of the protest and implement systemic change.
