bookworm asked what is the French Ã¿? with hash 1765aebf
<---- snip ---->
I must clarify that there is no letter "ÿ" in modern French. This letter was used in Old French and Middle French to represent a vowel sound, but it has been replaced by other letters such as "i" or "y" in modern French. It is still used in some other languages such as German and Turkish.
