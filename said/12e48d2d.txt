<---- snip ---->
Jainism is an ancient Indian religion that emphasizes non-violence, asceticism, and meditation. It has two main sects: Digambara, which is more ascetic and emphasizes the importance of monkhood, and Śvētāmbara, which is more liberal and allows lay people to practice the religion. The central tenets of Jainism are ahimsa (non-violence), anekantavada (non-absolutism), aparigraha (non-possession), and asceticism. Jainism also advocates a spiritual philosophy of self-control and detachment from material life and pleasure.
