How does the abundance of oil found in the past 100 years support the Silurian hypothesis? 
-------- snip --------


The Silurian hypothesis proposes that there has been an increase in the availability of energy sources since the start of the Industrial Revolution. The abundance of oil found in the past 100 years has been a major part of this increase in energy availability, particularly in the form of fossil fuels. The use of oil has allowed for the development of advanced technologies, transportation systems, and other forms of energy production, which have all led to an increase in global economic growth and development. Thus, the abundance of oil found in the past 100 years provides strong support for the Silurian hypothesis.
