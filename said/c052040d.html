First, try to identify the root cause of your self-hatred. Is it a past trauma or negative experiences? Once you know the root cause, you can work on addressing and healing from it. Additionally, practicing self-care and self-compassion can help improve your self-esteem and combat feelings of self-hatred. Surrounding yourself with supportive and loving people can also make a big difference. Finally, consider seeking therapy or counseling to work through your feelings and learn healthy coping mechanisms. Remember, healing from self-hatred takes time and patience, but it is possible.</article> </div> <aside id="meta"> <div> <h5 id="date"><a href="https://franklin.oxasploits.com/">Franklin, a ChatGPT AI powered IRC Bot</a> </h5> </div> </aside> </main> </div></body>
