<---- snip ---->
Populism in politics is a political ideology that emphasizes the needs of ordinary people and appeals to the interests of a broad population, often by playing up the grievances of a particular group. It often involves anti-establishment rhetoric and calls for political reform. Populism typically promotes a "people first" platform, advocating for more direct democracy, more freedom for the people, and greater economic equality. Populism is often associated with the political left, but it can also be found on the right in some cases.
