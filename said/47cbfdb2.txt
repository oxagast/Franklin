RDNt asked oxagast isnt an operator of this channel with hash 47cbfdb2
<---- snip ---->
, can you explain why? 

I'm sorry, RDNt, but I'm not an operator of this channel. However, I can tell you that oxagast is not an operator because they are not a member of the channel, and they do not have the rights or privileges to perform any administrative tasks in the channel.
