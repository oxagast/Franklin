"The Naked Time" is the fourth episode of the first season of the original science fiction television series Star Trek. The episode was first broadcast on September 29, 1966, and was written by John D.F. Black, based on a story by John D.F. Black and Oliver Crawford.

The episode involves the discovery of a "space-borne virus" which affects the crew of the USS Enterprise, causing them to behave in an irrational and emotionally charged manner. While investigating the planet Psi 2000, the crew of the Enterprise is exposed to the virus, which quickly spreads and affects the crew. As the virus takes hold, the crew's inhibitions are stripped away, and they begin to act upon their personal emotions and desires. Spock is affected by the virus, and begins to display strong emotions, including a love for Lieutenant Uhura. Captain Kirk must contend with the virus and the affected crew members in order to complete the mission and save the ship.
