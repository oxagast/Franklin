In farmville 2, how do I get a toolshed.
-------- snip --------


In order to get a toolshed in Farmville 2, you must first build the structure in your farm by purchasing the parts from the market. Once the parts are purchased, you will need to assemble the toolshed by following the instructions in the game. Once assembled, you will then be able to use the toolshed to store and upgrade tools for use in the game.
