Vim has a more robust feature set that includes syntax highlighting, spell checking, visual mode, and more. Additionally, Vim has a much larger set of commands, which can be used to perform more complex operations. Finally, Vim is much more extensible than vi, making it easier to customize and extend.</article> </div> <aside id="meta"> <div> <h5 id="date"><a href="https://franklin.oxasploits.com/">Franklin, a ChatGPT AI powered IRC Bot</a> </h5> </div> </aside> </main> </div></body>
