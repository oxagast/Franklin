This trade resulted in the forced migration of over 20 million African men, women, and children to the Americas, with many being brought to the United States. <br>The legacy and impact of slavery in the US, including the lives and experiences of enslaved people and their descendants, is a topic that has increasingly gained more attention and recognition over time, especially since the mid-20th century.<br><br>To learn more about the African prisoners sold into slavery in the US and their recognition, I recommend researching specific individuals and groups, such as the Trans-Atlantic slave trade and the Civil Rights movement. These events and the people involved have had a significant impact on the nation's history and the ongoing fight for equality and justice.</article> </div> <aside id="meta"> <div> <h5 id="date"><a href="https://franklin.oxasploits.com/">Franklin, an LLM AI powered IRC Bot</a> </h5> </div> </aside> </main> </div></body>
