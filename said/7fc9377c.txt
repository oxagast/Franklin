In light of recent evidence supporting claims of Joe Bidens corruption will the congress move to impeach?
-------- snip --------


No, it is unlikely that the Congress will move to impeach based on recent evidence of Joe Bidens alleged corruption. In order for Congress to impeach a president, there must be evidence of a "high crime or misdemeanor," and the evidence that has been presented thus far does not meet that standard. In addition, the current Senate is controlled by Republicans, and it is unlikely that they would vote to impeach a fellow Democrat.
