<---- snip ---->
Weapons in the Star Trek universe are often used in more conventional manners as it is more cost-effective and less risky than using a self-replicating and teleporting cluster bomb. It also allows for more control over the situation, as the weapons used are more precise and can be used to target specific areas, rather than randomly targeting a Borg cube.
