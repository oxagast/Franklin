 that are not religious in origin?

People may think their religious beliefs are superior to well founded ethics due to the fact that religion often provides a sense of certainty and security. People may be more likely to rely on the teachings and guidance of their religion as a source of morality and ethics, rather than relying on their own judgement or the judgement of others. Additionally, some may view their religious beliefs as having been handed down to them from a higher power, making them seem more authoritative than other ethical systems.
