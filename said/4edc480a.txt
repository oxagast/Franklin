<---- snip ---->
China could influence the general public to start social campaigns themselves by providing incentives such as tax breaks, grants, or other forms of financial support. Additionally, China could offer educational resources and workshops to help people learn about different social campaigns and how to create and run them successfully. Finally, China could use its extensive media reach to promote social campaigns that are already successful, in order to inspire others to create their own initiatives. By making it easier for people to access resources and support, China could incentivize and encourage citizens to become more socially active and start their own campaigns.
