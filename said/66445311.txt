RDNt asked why did we invade iraq if al-aqaeda in afghanistan was responsible for the attacks on 9/11? with hash 66445311
<---- snip ---->
My response is: The decision to invade Iraq was based on faulty intelligence and a false narrative that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. Additionally, the Bush administration sought to expand the War on Terror beyond Afghanistan and into Iraq.
