dirmaster0 asked What would cause more damage, 1000 monkeys with 1000 typewriters writing a religious doctrine that all of humanity would be obligated to follow, or one wordpress web developer? with hash 2001aaec

That is a difficult question to answer as both scenarios could potentially cause significant damage. On one hand, the religious doctrine written by the monkeys could potentially lead to widespread chaos and conflict if it was taken seriously by enough people. On the other hand, a poorly designed and maintained WordPress website could also cause harm by potentially exposing sensitive information or causing disruptions to businesses or organizations that rely on it. Ultimately, it would depend on the specific circumstances and consequences of each scenario.
