<---- snip ---->
Religious leaders often claim that only a small minority of people are going to Heaven because they want to emphasize the importance of religious salvation and the need to follow the teachings of their faith in order to be saved. They often argue that this is the only way to ensure one's place in Heaven and to avoid the consequences of an eternity spent in Hell.
