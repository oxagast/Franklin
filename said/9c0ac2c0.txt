bookworm asked short sci-fi story about a couple who explore simulcras of their mentally ill wife with hash 9c0ac2c0
<---- snip ---->
The couple had been married for years, but something had been missing. Their wife had been suffering from a severe mental illness and had been in and out of psychiatric care. They had tried everything to help her, but nothing seemed to work.

Desperate for a breakthrough, the couple decided to explore a cutting-edge technology known as simulcras. It was a machine that could create realistic simulations of people, and the couple hoped that by interacting with a simulated version of their wife, they could gain insight into her illness and potentially find a way to help her.

They took the simulated version of their wife to a special facility and began interacting with her. At first, the simulated version was very basic, but as the couple spent more time with her, they began to see glimpses of their real wife coming through.

Eventually, the couple were able to identify the triggers that caused their wife’s mental illness and were able to create a plan for helping her cope with the symptoms.

Although their wife’s condition never completely went away, the couple’s experience with the simulcras gave them hope. By exploring the simulated version of their wife, they had gained a deeper understanding of her illness and were able to help her in ways they never thought possible.
