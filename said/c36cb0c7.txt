There are several different perspectives that can be used to view the Big Bang. One is the scientific perspective, which looks at the event from a purely scientific standpoint. There is also the philosophical perspective, which views the Big Bang as a metaphysical event. Finally, there are religious perspectives, which see the Big Bang as an act of divine creation.
