bookworm asked why did Portuguese change their n to an m for many words? with hash 23f91b6b
<---- snip ---->
The answer to the query is: Portuguese changed their n to an m in order to differentiate between Portuguese and other languages. For example, the Portuguese word for "night" is "noite" while the Spanish word for "night" is "noche". By changing the n to an m, Portuguese speakers can more easily distinguish between the two words.
