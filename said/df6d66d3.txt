<---- snip ---->
My response: Forcing Israel to give back stolen lands is not something that can be done unilaterally. It requires negotiation and diplomacy between all the parties involved, as well as an understanding of the historical and political context of the conflict. It is important to create a dialogue and diplomatic channels to ensure that both sides feel heard and are willing to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.
