<---- snip ---->
The bodies response to exposure to formaldehyde can vary depending on the amount and length of exposure. Generally, short-term exposure to formaldehyde can cause irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat. Long-term exposure can lead to more serious health issues, such as coughing, wheezing, and asthma. It can also cause skin irritation, allergies, and in some cases, cancer.
