1. Antiparasitic medications: Medications such as pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine are the primary treatment for Toxoplasma gondii. These medications work to inhibit the growth of the parasite.

2. Corticosteroids: Corticosteroids, such as prednisone, are sometimes used to reduce inflammation associated with Toxoplasma gondii.

3. Antiviral medications: Certain antiviral medications, such as azithromycin and atovaquone, may be used in combination with antiparasitic medications.

4. Surgery: In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove infected tissue.

5. Immune globulin: Immune globulin, a form of medication made from donated blood, may be used to boost the immune system.

6. Oxygen therapy: Oxygen therapy may be used to help reduce inflammation and improve breathing in people with severe Toxoplasma gondii infections.
