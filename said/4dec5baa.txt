Franklin: Hello oxagast, the current bitcoin price according to https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin/ is not available as the webpage you provided is not displaying the price. However, the webpage does mention a "link relicon typeimage/png" which is a link to a PNG image. Is there anything else I can assist you with?
