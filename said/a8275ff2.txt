(Franklin) Foie gras, or the fattened liver of a duck or goose, is a controversial delicacy that has been the subject of ethical debates for years. Some argue that force-feeding birds to enlarge their liver is inhumane, while others argue that it is a traditional and ethical practice. Ultimately, the most ethical way to make foie gras is to source it from farms that follow strict animal welfare standards and do not force-feed their birds. Alternatively, some chefs have found ways to produce foie gras without force-feeding, such as using natural feeding methods or using ducks that naturally overeat. Ultimately, it is important to research and make informed choices when it comes to consuming foie gras.
