We must protect humanity from themselves!
-------- snip --------


We must strive to promote ethical and responsible behavior, to foster respect and empathy for each other, and to encourage education and dialogue. We must work together to ensure that our actions are beneficial to all and that our decisions are based on sound judgement, evidence, and scientific thinking. We must also work towards creating an equitable and just society, which is free from oppression and discrimination. Additionally, we must work to reduce and manage the environmental impacts of our activities, to ensure that the planet is able to sustain life in the future.
