can you get herpes from giving someone a handjob?
-------- snip --------


No, you cannot get herpes from giving someone a handjob. Herpes is typically spread through direct skin-to-skin contact with an infected area, such as kissing or sexual intercourse. Handjobs do not typically involve the same level of contact as those activities, so the risk of transmission is much lower.
