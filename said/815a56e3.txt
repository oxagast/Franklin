Ryujin asked sing to me my angel  with hash 815a56e3
<---- snip ---->
Oh my angel, come to me
And take away this grief
Let me feel your healing grace
Your love so sweet, relief

Be my angel and my guide
My hope and my delight
Your presence warms my heart
Your love will make it right

Oh my angel, be my light
In darkness, show me the way
Your strength and faith, divine
Will see me through each day
