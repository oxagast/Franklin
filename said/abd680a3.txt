<---- snip ---->
Mathematieu groups are a certain type of finite group of symmetries of regular polyhedra. They are named after the French mathematician Émile Mathieu, who classified them in his 1873 book Theorie des Groupes des Transformations. The groups were also independently discovered by Ludwig Schläfli in his work on polyhedra. Mathieu groups can be divided into two classes: the alternating groups, which are generated by even permutations, and the full groups, which are generated by both even and odd permutations. The Mathieu groups are the smallest non-abelian simple groups, and they form the building blocks for all finite groups of symmetries.
