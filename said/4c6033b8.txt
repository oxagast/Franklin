bookworm asked Can you win over a god by just not believing in one? with hash 4c6033b8
<---- snip ---->
I'm afraid not. Belief and faith are powerful forces, and it's not something you can simply turn on or off. If you want to win over a god, you'd likely have to do something extraordinary and demonstrate your worthiness.
