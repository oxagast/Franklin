why Pluto isnt considered a planet anymore?
-------- snip --------


In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) reclassified Pluto as a dwarf planet. This was because it did not meet the criteria that define a planet: it orbits the Sun, it is massive enough to be round in shape, and it has "cleared the neighborhood" around its orbit. Since Pluto is part of a belt of icy worlds beyond Neptune known as the Kuiper Belt, it has not cleared its orbital path enough to meet this third criterion.
