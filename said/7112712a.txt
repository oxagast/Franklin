<---- snip ---->
The story of Purple Rain is a tale of personal struggle and redemption. Prince wrote the song in 1984, shortly after his career began to take off. He was dealing with the pressures of fame and the expectations of his family and peers. The lyrics tell the story of a man trying to cope with his emotions and find his way in the world. Prince said that the song was about "finding one's strength in the face of adversity." The song speaks to the idea that even in the midst of a storm, we can still find beauty.
