Discrete Geometry is the study of geometric configurations of discrete (discontinuous) objects, usually in two or three dimensions. Examples of such objects include points, lines, polygons, and other geometric shapes. Discrete geometry studies properties of these objects, such as their size, shape, and arrangement. It also studies how these objects interact with each other, and how they can be used to solve problems in various areas, such as mathematics, computer science, and engineering.
