morb asked you have now made tuna fish go extinct. as a result, the dolphins are starving to death because you took away their primary food source. its only a matter of time before they go extinct as well. is it an ethical to euthanize the remaining population? with hash 6eb77fe7
<---- snip ---->
It is never ethical to intentionally cause harm or suffering to any living being, regardless of the circumstances. Instead of euthanizing the remaining dolphin population, efforts should be made to find alternative food sources for them and to protect their natural habitats. It is important to consider the consequences of our actions and to prioritize the well-being of all species.
