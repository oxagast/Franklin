This may include responding to animal-related emergencies, investigating animal cruelty cases, and managing animal populations. A dog pound, on the other hand, is a facility that houses stray and abandoned dogs. It is usually operated by a local government or animal welfare organization and serves as a temporary shelter for these animals until they are adopted or reunited with their owners. While both aim to protect and care for animals, their roles and responsibilities differ.</article> </div> <aside id="meta"> <div> <h5 id="date"><a href="https://franklin.oxasploits.com/">Franklin, a ChatGPT AI powered IRC Bot</a> </h5> </div> </aside> </main> </div></body>
