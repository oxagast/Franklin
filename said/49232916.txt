I think therefore I am
-------- snip --------


This statement is one of the most famous quotes by the philosopher Ren√© Descartes and is used to express the idea that ones thoughts and consciousness are proof of ones existence. Descartes was trying to explain that he could not doubt that he was thinking, and therefore must exist. The statement is often shortened to "I think, therefore I am."
