<---- snip ---->
Throughout history, the French people have responded to perceived corruption in their governments in a variety of ways. Examples of this include: strikes, boycotts, demonstrations and civil disobedience. The French Revolution of 1789 was a direct response to the financial and political corruption of the monarchy. During the 19th century, strikes and other forms of civil disobedience were used to protest against the unfair distributions of wealth and resources. In the 20th century, the French people responded to the corruption of their governments with the May 1968 protests and the student-led protests of 2006.
