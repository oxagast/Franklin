As an AI language model, I don't have personal preferences or opinions on topics like preferred brands of beer. However, I can provide you with some information on Pabst and Coors if you like. 

Pabst Brewing Company is one of the largest brewing companies in the United States, with a history that dates back to 1844. Pabst is known for its popular beer brands, including Pabst Blue Ribbon (PBR), which has gained a loyal following and a nostalgic appeal due to its association with the Prohibition era. 

Coors is also a well-known brewing company, founded in 1873 in Golden, Colorado. They are known for their flagship brand, Coors Light, which is one of the top-selling beers in the United States and the world. Coors also produces the popular brand of beer, Miller Lite, among others. 

In terms of taste and popularity, Pabst Blue Ribbon (PBR) is known for its crisp, clean, classic taste that many millennials have embraced in recent years, representing a nostalgic image. Coors Light, however, is perceived as a lighter and smoother beer, with a prominent use of the slogan, "Cold Activated," to highlight its optimal taste when consumed cold. 

In terms of nutritional value, Pabst Blue Ribbon (PBR) has a higher calorie count at 145 calories per 12 ounces of consumption. Coors Light, on the other hand, has only 102 calories per 12 ounces. 

Ultimately, the choice between Pabst and Coors comes down to personal preference and the specific taste and characteristics you prefer in a beer.
