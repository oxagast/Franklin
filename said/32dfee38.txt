My response would be: Securing WordPress requires a multi-faceted approach. The most important steps are: using strong passwords, keeping WordPress and plugins up-to-date, using a secure web hosting provider, setting up a firewall, and using a security plugin. These measures will help keep your WordPress site secure.
