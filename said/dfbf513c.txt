This can include physical, emotional, or psychological harm, as well as neglect or manipulation. In the context of technology, abuse can refer to the misuse or exploitation of systems, networks, or personal information. It is important to recognize and address abuse in all its forms, whether it is directed at individuals, groups, or the larger community.
