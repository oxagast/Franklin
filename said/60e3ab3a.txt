bookworm asked Do churches and political institutions use dichotomies to control the public? with hash 60e3ab3a
<---- snip ---->
Yes, churches and political institutions can and do use dichotomies to control the public. Dichotomies are used to create categories of “us” and “them” or “right” and “wrong.” This can be used to divide people into groups and create a sense of belonging or exclusion. It can also be used to reinforce certain beliefs or values and limit the range of acceptable opinions. By using dichotomies, political and religious institutions can control the public by establishing certain norms and boundaries that must be adhered to.
