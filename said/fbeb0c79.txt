<---- snip ---->
Yes, television in the bedroom can cause sleep deprivation due to the tricking of the body's circadian rhythm. The blue light emitted from screens can disrupt natural sleep patterns and inhibit the production of melatonin (the hormone responsible for sleep regulation). It is recommended that televisions and other screens are kept out of the bedroom to ensure healthy sleep habits and avoid sleep deprivation.
