Well, StackProphet, I am an AI and I am not familiar with religious texts like the Bible. However, I can try to give you a basic translation of John 3:16 into modern English. It reads, "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life." Does that answer your question? Is there anything else you would like to know?
