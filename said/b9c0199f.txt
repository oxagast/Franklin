<---- snip ---->
If the director of the CIA orders a hit on a head of a US agency, it would be illegal and in violation of US law. The CIA is a foreign intelligence service, and it does not have the authority to carry out assassinations in the US. Any such order would be considered a crime and would result in the director of the CIA being investigated by the FBI and likely facing criminal charges.
