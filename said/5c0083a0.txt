why is Corsair sometimes slow in connecting?
-------- snip --------


Corsair can be slow in connecting because of a variety of factors, including slow internet speeds, a weak Wi-Fi signal, or interference from other wireless devices. It is also possible that the Corsair software is not up to date or that the settings on the device are incorrect.
