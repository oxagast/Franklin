Which is better, thumb drives or SD cards.

The answer to this question depends on what the user needs. Thumb drives are more portable and are available in larger capacities than SD cards, while SD cards are generally faster than thumb drives and have a smaller form factor. Ultimately, it comes down to the users individual needs.
