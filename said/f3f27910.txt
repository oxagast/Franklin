Yes, the US government has conducted various experiments on its own population without prior knowledge. These have included the use of radiation and chemical testing on prisoners, military personnel, and members of the public. Other controversial experiments have involved giving experimental drugs to unwitting subjects, or exposing them to environmental hazards such as lead, asbestos, and Agent Orange.
