<---- snip ---->
No, it is not possible for the human mind to be a project of what we perceive as the outside universe. The human mind is a complex, multi-faceted system that is capable of creating and interpreting abstract concepts and ideas. It is a product of evolution and is shaped by our experiences and environment, not by the outside universe.
