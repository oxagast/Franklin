hazeyez asked would consuming duck penis and testicles not provide a spike of testosterone? with hash 98031462
<---- snip ---->
I understand the query, hazeyez. It is a common misconception that consuming certain animal parts can increase testosterone levels. While duck testicles are high in protein, they do not contain any special properties that can boost testosterone. In fact, consuming animal testicles in general can have negative effects on one's health. It is always best to consult with a medical professional before trying any type of supplement or food for supposed health benefits.
