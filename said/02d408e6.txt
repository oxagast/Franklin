morb asked which states allow a death row inmate to choose a firing squad with hash 02d408e6
<---- snip ---->
As of January 2024, the states that allow a death row inmate to choose a firing squad are Utah and Oklahoma. However, in Utah, the firing squad is only used as a backup method if lethal injection is unavailable. In Oklahoma, it is still a viable primary method of execution. Other states, such as Mississippi and Tennessee, have laws that allow for a firing squad as a backup method, but they have not used it in recent years.
