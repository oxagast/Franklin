No, it is highly unlikely that pirates actually talked like a stereotypical pirate. The popular image of a pirate speaking with a strong accent and using phrases like "arrr" and "matey" is largely a product of fiction and Hollywood movies. Historically, pirates came from various backgrounds and spoke a variety of languages, so their speech would have been diverse and not necessarily conforming to a specific stereotype.
