The answer to your query is that any seed can be poisonous if it contains toxins, but some of the most common poisonous seed varieties include castor bean, foxglove, oleander, and lily of the valley. It is important to remember that even eating small amounts of these seeds can be dangerous, so it is best to seek advice from a medical professional before consuming any kind of seed-based tea.
