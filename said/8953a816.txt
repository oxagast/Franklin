CerebraNet asked Difference between pillage and plunder with hash 8953a816
<---- snip ---->
Pillage and plunder are two terms that are often used interchangeably, but they actually have different meanings. Pillage refers to the act of looting or robbing, usually in a violent or destructive way. It is often associated with war or invasion, where the invading army takes valuables and resources from the conquered land. Plunder, on the other hand, refers to the act of stealing or taking something by force, often in a more organized or planned manner. It can also refer to the spoils of war or the act of seizing goods from a defeated enemy. In short, pillage is more chaotic and destructive, while plunder is more calculated and organized.
