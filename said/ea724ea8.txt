<---- snip ---->
The creepiest cult game ever created is probably Silent Hill 2, a survival horror game released for the PlayStation 2 in 2001. The game revolves around a character named James Sunderland who travels to the horrific town of Silent Hill in search of his missing wife. The game features dark and disturbing imagery, a haunting soundtrack, and a story that delves deeply into the psychological horror of cults and the occult. It's considered one of the scariest video games ever made.
