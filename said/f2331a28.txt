Jesus demonstrated his love for all people through his actions, such as healing the sick, feeding the hungry, and welcoming children. Jesus also taught us to love others as ourselves and that God loves everyone. Jesusâ€™ ultimate sacrifice on the cross was the clearest expression of his love for all people.
