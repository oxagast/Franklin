CerebraNet asked If intelligence can not be measured, then why are there IQ tests.
<---- snip ---->
IQ tests measure a person's mental ability relative to their age group. IQ tests are designed to measure aspects of intelligence such as problem-solving, abstract thinking, spatial perception, and memory. While IQ tests are not perfect, they provide useful information about a person's cognitive abilities. https://franklin.oxasploits.com/said/9bc932c8
