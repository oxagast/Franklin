booksworms asked How many queries do you get per day? with hash daf3a49c
<---- snip ---->
The number of queries you get per day will depend on the size and scope of your website and the type of queries you are receiving. For example, a small website with a limited number of pages may only get a few queries per day, while a larger website with a wide range of content may get hundreds or even thousands of queries each day.
