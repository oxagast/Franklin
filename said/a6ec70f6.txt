bookworm asked Does a disparity in wage to cost of living increase crime? with hash a6ec70f6
<---- snip ---->
Yes, research has shown that disparities in wage to cost of living can increase crime. This is due to the fact that people who cannot make ends meet may resort to criminal activities in order to make money. Additionally, areas with high wage disparities and a low cost of living tend to have higher levels of poverty, which can also lead to more criminal activity.
