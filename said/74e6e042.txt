morb asked how can I play ipx/spx ms-dos games with my friends over the internet

Unfortunately, it is not possible to play IPX/SPX MS-DOS games with your friends over the Internet. The only way to do this is to set up a local network using either a router or dedicated hardware. This will allow you to play the games as if you were on a local LAN. https://franklin.oxasploits.com/said/74e6e042
