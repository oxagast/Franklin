who is thomas crapper
-------- snip --------


Thomas Crapper was a plumber and inventor who popularized the flush toilet in Victorian England. He was born in Yorkshire, England in 1836 and became a master plumber in 1861. He invented a number of plumbing innovations, including the ballcock, a float-operated valve used to fill cisterns with water. He was also the first person to patent a type of valve used in flush toilets. He is often mistakenly credited with inventing the flush toilet, but the technology had been around since the 16th century.
