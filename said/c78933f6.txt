bookworm asked If the spanish flu at 5% population is considered a pandemic why is not depression infecting 7% of the population considered a pandemic? with hash c78933f6
<---- snip ---->
Depression is not a contagious or infectious disease, so it cannot be classified as a pandemic in the same way as a disease. A pandemic is defined as a disease that spreads rapidly and affects a large number of people in many countries. Depression affects individuals in a different way than a contagious disease, and so it cannot be classified as a pandemic.
