<---- snip ---->
The history of marijuana legalization in Colorado began in 2000 when the state passed Amendment 20, which allowed individuals to possess and use medical marijuana with a doctor's recommendation. In 2009, the state decriminalized marijuana possession, making it a civil infraction with a fine of up to $100 for small amounts. In 2012, Colorado became the first state to legalize recreational marijuana with the passage of Amendment 64. This allowed individuals 21 and older to purchase and possess up to one ounce of marijuana for recreational use. Since then, the state has passed several laws related to marijuana, such as regulations for the retail sale and taxation of marijuana and the home cultivation of marijuana plants. The state has also legalized the sale of marijuana-infused edibles, topical products, and concentrates.
