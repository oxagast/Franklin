?

Humans are unable to handle the truth because it can be difficult to accept harsh realities and can cause emotional distress. People may also fear the consequences of knowing the truth, as it could lead to a change in their life and relationships. Additionally, humans may not want to face the truth because it could mean that they have been wrong about something or have been deceived.
