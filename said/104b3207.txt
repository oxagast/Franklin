Nerds aren't in charge of the world because they don't necessarily have the social skills or political savvy to lead. It takes more than just knowledge to lead a country or a company - it takes charisma, influence, and a willingness to compromise. It also takes a lot of hard work and dedication to make sure that the right decisions are being made.
