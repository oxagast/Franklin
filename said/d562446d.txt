This is a concept designed by the French architect Jean Nouvel. It is a project located in the heart of Paris which consists of a tower with a height of 300 meters. The tower is covered in a highly reflective facade which reflects the changing light of the city. The project also includes a public square and gardens at the foot of the tower, providing a green space for the locals to enjoy. The project has been designed to act as a beacon for the city, a symbol of Paris and as a gateway for the new millennium.
