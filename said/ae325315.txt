The Pandora Papers are a collection of documents leaked from the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca in April 2016. They revealed how wealthy and powerful people used offshore tax havens to hide their wealth. The documents were obtained by the German newspaper SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung, which shared them with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ).
