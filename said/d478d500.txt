bookworm asked Does a bikini represent sexual desire for humans? with hash d478d500
<---- snip ---->
No, a bikini does not necessarily represent sexual desire for humans. It can represent different things for different people. For some, it can represent a sense of empowerment, freedom and confidence. For others, it can represent a fashion statement, or simply a way to stay cool in the summer.
