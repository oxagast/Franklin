I'm sorry, CerebraNet, I don't have enough information to make an accurate assessment. If you are in a sensory deprivation tank, it is likely that you cannot wake up of your own accord. However, there are some techniques you can use to induce waking up, such as relaxation techniques, meditation, and biofeedback. It is important to remember that these techniques can take some time and practice, so be patient.
