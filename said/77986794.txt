The answer generated by the bot is: According to a survey by sex toy company Adam & Eve, 45% of American women own at least one sex toy, while only 29% of men do. However, this may not be a completely accurate representation as it relies on self-reporting and does not account for individuals who may not feel comfortable disclosing this information. Additionally, this survey does not specify the number of sex toys owned, so it is possible that some individuals may have multiple toys, skewing the results.
