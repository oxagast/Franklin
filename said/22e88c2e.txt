I am not aware of a specific incident where a cop has tried to interfere with an entire fire department, but it is not uncommon for law enforcement and fire departments to have disagreements or conflicts over jurisdiction or procedures. It is important for both parties to work together and communicate effectively in emergency situations to ensure public safety.
