`SSB asked Why 42?
<---- snip ---->
The number 42 is a reference to the science fiction novel The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams. In the novel, the number 42 is said to be “the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything”. While the answer itself is never revealed in the book, it has become a popular cultural reference and a symbol of the absurd. https://franklin.oxasploits.com/said/0157d491
