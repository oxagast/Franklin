It's difficult to say whether Randy Quaid with long hair would be a good fit to play Karl Marx, as it ultimately depends on the director's vision for the character and Quaid's acting ability. However, it is important to remember that an actor's personal life and behavior should not necessarily impact their ability to portray a character on screen.
