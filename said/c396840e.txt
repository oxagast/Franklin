aestetix asked how do you use a sounding rod?
<---- snip ---->
A sounding rod is a device used to measure the depth of water. It is usually a long pole with a weight at the end. To use a sounding rod, the user stands at the edge of the water, holds the pole horizontally and drops the weighted end into the water. The user then counts the number of feet the pole sinks before it touches the bottom of the body of water. The depth is then recorded. https://franklin.oxasploits.com/said/c396840e
