CerebraNet asked Do people who play Half-Life want to escape from their real life with hash 72e98db7
<---- snip ---->
My response is: Some people may use Half-Life as an escape from their real life, but for most players it is a way to immerse themselves in a world of adventure and challenge. It's an opportunity to explore, discover, and overcome obstacles in a way that is not possible in the real world.
