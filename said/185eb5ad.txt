According to Islamic belief, Muhammad was the last prophet of God and the founder of Islam. He is believed to have received revelations from God through the angel Gabriel, which were later compiled into the holy book of Islam, the Quran. The truth of his prophethood is a matter of faith and belief for Muslims, and is not something that can be proven or disproven through historical evidence.
