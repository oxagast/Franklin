bookworm asked do bacteria signal when to eat or do humans just decide to eat? with hash 1cc80b7c
<---- snip ---->
That's an interesting question! Bacteria don't actually signal when to eat, but they do respond to environmental cues in order to decide what to eat. For example, some bacteria may detect the presence of a certain kind of sugar and move towards it. Humans, on the other hand, have the ability to make conscious decisions about what, when, and how much to eat.
