<---- snip ---->
Stupid hacker bullshit can refer to various actions or behaviors of hackers that are seen as pointless, harmful, or just plain annoying. This can include things like creating viruses or malware, hacking for personal gain or to cause chaos, or engaging in online trolling or harassment. These actions not only harm individuals and organizations, but also give a bad reputation to the entire hacking community. It's important for hackers to use their skills ethically and responsibly, rather than engaging in stupid hacker bullshit.
