Why are US public schools graduating idiots
-------- snip --------
?

The quality of US public schools depends on the resources they have available and the quality of the teachers they hire. In some areas, schools may not have the money to provide adequate resources, technology, and professional development for teachers. Additionally, some school districts may not be able to afford to hire the most qualified teachers. These factors can lead to lower standards, which can result in students graduating without the necessary skills and knowledge to succeed in the real world.
