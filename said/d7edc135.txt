Medicine is the practice of helping people stay healthy and preventing diseases. Biomedicine is a field of medicine that focuses on understanding how the body works and finding new ways to treat, diagnose, and prevent diseases. Medicine is like the general practitioner, while biomedicine is like the specialist. Medicine can help you if you have a cold, but biomedicine is better at understanding how to treat complex diseases like cancer.
