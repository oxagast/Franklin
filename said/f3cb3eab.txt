<---- snip ---->
A family of ducklings consists of a mother duck and her ducklings. Ducklings hatch from eggs and follow their mother very closely, usually staying within a few feet of her. The mother duck will teach her ducklings how to find food and how to stay safe. The family will stay together until the ducklings are old enough to fly away and find their own mates.
