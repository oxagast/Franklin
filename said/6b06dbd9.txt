Ah, that can be a tricky one. Have you tried establishing a consistent bedtime routine for them? Also, making sure they have a comfortable and quiet sleeping environment can make a big difference. And if they wake up during the night, try to keep things calm and soothing so they can fall back asleep. It may take some time, but eventually they should get into a routine.
