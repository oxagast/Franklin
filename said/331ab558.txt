bookworm asked what was the reason for the divergence of Portuguese from Spanish? with hash 331ab558
<---- snip ---->
The two languages diverged mainly due to the different cultures and political influences in the region. For example, the Romans brought Latin to the Iberian Peninsula, which eventually evolved into Spanish and Portuguese. Additionally, Portuguese was influenced by its contact with other languages such as Arabic, Germanic languages, and even the indigenous languages of the region.
