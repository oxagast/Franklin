The children of the soldier should be told that their father was performing his duty to protect our country and its people from harm. He made the ultimate sacrifice by putting himself in harms way to protect the safety of others. His actions were brave and honorable, and in doing so, he demonstrated the highest level of commitment to serving his country.
