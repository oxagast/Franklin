CerebraNet asked How can I find the ipad billing period through the safari browser with hash 1762fd84

Unfortunately, there isn’t a way to view your iPad billing period through the Safari browser. To view your iPad billing period, you must log into your Apple ID account on a computer or mobile device and select the “Subscriptions” tab. From there, you will be able to view your current billing period and all other subscription-related information.
