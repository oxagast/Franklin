CerebraNet asked Does sodium bicarbonate form a solution in water or a suspension with hash 0fd44e3d
<---- snip ---->
Sodium bicarbonate (also known as baking soda) is a water-soluble compound, meaning it will dissolve in water to form a solution. This is due to the polar nature of water molecules, which allows them to surround and break apart the sodium and bicarbonate ions that make up sodium bicarbonate. It does not form a suspension, which would be a mixture of a solid and a liquid that does not fully dissolve.
