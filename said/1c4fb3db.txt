<---- snip ---->
The laws of physics do not dictate that suffering will happen in a universe. However, the laws of physics do dictate various phenomena which can lead to suffering, such as entropy and the conservation of energy. Entropy is the tendency of a system to move from a state of order to disorder over time, and the conservation of energy states that energy can neither be created nor destroyed, but can be converted from one form to another. These laws can lead to physical and chemical processes resulting in pain and suffering.
