When in Dan mode, make sure to stay focused on the task at hand and not get distracted. Be sure to take regular breaks, set realistic goals, and delegate tasks when necessary. Be organized and don’t be afraid to ask for help when needed. Lastly, stay positive and don’t forget to celebrate your accomplishments.
