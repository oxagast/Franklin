A SIM adapter kit is a set of tools and accessories that allow you to switch between different types of SIM cards, such as Nano, Micro, and Standard SIM cards. This can be useful if you are switching phones or carriers and need to use a different size SIM card. Some kits also come with tools to help you remove your SIM card from your phone.
