zyme asked Other than pasteurization and filtering how is Apple Cider Different from Apple Juice? with hash 5f21445c
<---- snip ---->
Apple cider is typically made from fresh, unpasteurized apples and is usually less sweet than apple juice. Apple cider is sometimes made with a mix of different types of apples to create a unique flavor. It is usually left unfiltered, which gives it a cloudy appearance. Apple cider is usually served cold, whereas apple juice is usually served at room temperature. Apple cider is also naturally carbonated, which gives it a slightly bubbly texture.
