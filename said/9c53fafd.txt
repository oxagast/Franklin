bookworm asked What happens to a Zoroastrian if they do not follow their religion and get cremated instead of laying the boady out to be eaten. with hash 9c53fafd
<---- snip ---->
If a Zoroastrian does not follow the religion and decides to be cremated instead of having their body exposed for vultures to consume, their soul will not be able to achieve salvation. It is believed that the soul of a person who is not laid out according to the Zoroastrian tradition will be trapped in the material world and unable to reach the spiritual realm.
