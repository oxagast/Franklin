How do you know the laws of physics apply to all objects in the universe, regardless of where they originated

?

The laws of physics are derived from mathematical principles, which are universal and apply to all objects in the universe, regardless of their origin. The mathematical equations used to describe the laws of physics are consistent throughout the universe, meaning that they will always apply to all objects. These equations can be used to predict the behavior of any physical system, regardless of its origin, and they have been tested and confirmed by experiments conducted in laboratories on Earth, as well as by observations made in space.
