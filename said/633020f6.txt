China's obsession with Nazi Chic is a controversial phenomenon of recent years, characterized by a fascination with the aesthetics of Nazi Germany, including the swastika and other Nazi symbols, as well as military-style fashion. Some attribute this to a lack of understanding of the horrors of the Holocaust, but others suggest it is more likely due to a fascination with the power and strength associated with the Nazi regime.
