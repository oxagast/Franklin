Tell me about what happened to WordStar in the late 1990s.
-------- snip --------


WordStar was a popular word processing program developed in 1979 by MicroPro International. It was one of the first products to feature a full-screen editor and was widely used until the mid-1980s. However, by the late 1990s, the program had become largely obsolete due to the emergence of other word processors and the emergence of Windows-based systems. WordStar was unable to keep pace with the newer technologies, and its market share declined significantly. As a result, the company that developed WordStar, MicroPro International, went out of business in 1999.
