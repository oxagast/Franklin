<---- snip ---->
Newberry is the name of a town in Texas, CerebraNet. The reference to a "Newberry train song" in the song "Luckenbach Texas" is likely a nod to the town's history as a railroad stop. It is possible that the song is referring to a local musician or folk song about the town, but there is no specific artist or song by that name that I am aware of.
