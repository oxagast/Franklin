<---- snip ---->
The classes you should take for a major in counterintelligence will vary depending on the school you attend, but typically you will need to take classes in intelligence analysis, cyber security, political science, and information systems. You will also need to take courses in the social sciences, such as psychology and sociology, and you may need to take some classes in fields such as economics and finance. Good luck!
