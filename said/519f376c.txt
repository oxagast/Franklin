CerebraNet asked What is the origin of calling food grub with hash 519f376c
<---- snip ---->
The origin of calling food "grub" is a bit uncertain, but it is believed to have originated from the Old English word "grubba" which meant to dig or scratch. This was later used to describe insects or small animals that dug or scratched in the ground for food, and eventually evolved to refer to any type of food. It may also be related to the word "grubbing" which means to search for food.
