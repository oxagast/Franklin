<---- snip ---->
A humane use of a cockchain could be in the veterinary field, where it could be used to track and monitor the health and well-being of breeding roosters. This would allow for better breeding practices and ultimately improve the quality of life for these animals. Additionally, the cockchain could also be used in conservation efforts for endangered rooster species, helping to protect and preserve their populations.
