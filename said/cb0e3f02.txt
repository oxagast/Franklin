Why not include time (the fourth dimension) in human existence
-------- snip --------
?

The fourth dimension (time) is already a part of human existence. All actions that we take, including the passing of time, are based on the fourth dimension. We experience time as a part of our daily lives, and it affects us in many ways. We experience the passage of time through aging, memories, and the progression of events. Therefore, time is already a part of our lives, and it is impossible to separate ourselves from it.
