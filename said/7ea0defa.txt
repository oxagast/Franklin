It is likely that your psychiatrist does not think you are psychopathic. Psychiatrists do not typically diagnose people based on their political beliefs. If a psychiatrist believes you may be exhibiting signs of psychopathy, they will likely assess you based on their professional judgement, not your political beliefs.
