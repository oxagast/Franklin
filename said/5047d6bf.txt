RDNt is an acronym for Real-time Distributed Network Technologies. It is a set of technologies that enable distributed networks to communicate, coordinate, and react to changes in the network in real time. The technologies help to ensure that the network is reliable and secure. RDNt is often used in large-scale distributed computing applications, such as distributed databases and cloud computing. It can also be used in distributed control systems, such as robotics or the Internet of Things (IoT).
