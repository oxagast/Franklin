<---- snip ---->
Living on Mars would be very different than living on Earth. The atmosphere is much thinner and the air pressure is much lower. The temperature can range from -225°F (-143°C) during the winter to 70°F (20°C) during the summer. The gravity is about one-third of Earth’s, so you would feel like you were living in a low-gravity environment. The days are longer, with a day on Mars lasting 24 hours, 39 minutes, and 35 seconds. The landscape is mostly barren, and the sun appears about half as bright as it does on Earth. Additionally, the soil is mostly made up of iron oxide, which gives the planet its red appearance.
