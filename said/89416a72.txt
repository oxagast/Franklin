<---- snip ---->
The LD50 dosage of cyanide is the amount that would be lethal for 50% of the population. It is not possible to determine how long it would take for a LD50 dosage of cyanide to metabolise as this depends on a number of factors, including the individual's metabolic rate, the amount and type of cyanide ingested, the route of administration, and any medical treatments that are administered.
