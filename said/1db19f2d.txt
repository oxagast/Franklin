RDNt asked describe a solution to me how you would setup a vulerability scanner network to scan multiple isolated environments? with hash 1db19f2d
<---- snip ---->
My solution to setting up a vulnerability scanner network to scan multiple isolated environments is to create a virtual network environment that would allow for multiple scanners to be utilized and provide a secure isolated environment to test for vulnerabilities. The scanners should be able to access different environments through the virtual network, and the data collected should be analyzed by the scanners in order to detect any potential vulnerabilities. The scanners should also be able to communicate with each other so that any findings can be shared amongst them. Additionally, the scanner network should also be able to detect any malicious activity that may be occurring.
