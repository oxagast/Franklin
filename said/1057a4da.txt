<---- snip ---->
Most Christians do not hate the morning star, but they may have a different understanding of it than other people. Christians recognize the morning star as a biblical term used to refer to Jesus Christ. They see it as a sign of His return and a reminder of His sovereignty over creation. Therefore, the morning star is a symbol of hope and faith for many Christians.
