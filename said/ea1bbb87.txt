<---- snip ---->
Michigan J. Frog is known for his silent, but enthusiastic, patriotism and patriotism is important to Warner Bros. Studios. Bugs Bunny, while lovable and popular, is not known for his patriotism. Michigan J. Frog was chosen as the mascot to represent the studio's commitment to patriotism and the American spirit.
