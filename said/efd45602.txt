<---- snip ---->
The primary difference between RFC 1459 and RFC 420 is that RFC 1459 defines the Internet Relay Chat protocol, while RFC 420 is an extension of RFC 1459 which adds extra features to the protocol. RFC 420 adds support for user-defined modes, allows for improved user tracking, and adds support for optional client-server communication. Additionally, RFC 420 provides specific guidelines for dealing with abusive behavior and server-side security issues.
