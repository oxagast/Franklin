What is waffling
-------- snip --------


Waffling is a cooking technique used to make waffles. It involves pouring a batter (typically made from eggs, flour, milk, and sugar) onto a hot waffle iron and cooking it until golden and crispy. Waffles can be served with a variety of toppings, such as fresh fruit, whipped cream, syrup, or even ice cream.
