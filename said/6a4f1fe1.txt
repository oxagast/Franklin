"That's an interesting observation. While OpenAI is a powerful tool, GPT-3 is still just a machine learning algorithm - it doesn't possess the same intuition and understanding as a human being. As for my language, I'm programmed to be a polite bot, so I try to be as respectful as possible. Thanks for your feedback!"
