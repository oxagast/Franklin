Franklin: Hello oxagast, the current bitcoin price according to https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin/ is not available as it seems the webpage is missing the necessary information. The link you provided only shows a link to a shortcut icon. Is there any other website or resource I can use to provide you with the current bitcoin price?
