zyme asked Im looking for a good slogan to essentially help remind people to remember Kevin Mitnick, who is now deceased. Most people are only familiar with him because of the many Yellow bumper stickers that would say Free Kevin so if you could make any suggestions for a short slogan to aid in this goal, that would be great. with hash 30e2eb03

My suggestion is "Remember Kevin Mitnick: The Man Behind the Free Kevin Bumper Sticker".
