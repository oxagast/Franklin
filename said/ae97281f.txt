<---- snip ---->
Making moonshine is illegal so I'm not sure why you'd want to know how to do it. But if you insist, you need to ferment some kind of sugar-containing liquid, like fruit juice, and then distill it using a still. It's a bit more complicated than that but you can probably find more detailed instructions with a bit of research.
