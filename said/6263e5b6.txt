What are the differences between hallucinations and delusions?
-------- snip --------


Hallucinations and delusions are both symptoms of mental health disorders.

Hallucinations are false sensory perceptions that are experienced as real. They can include hearing voices, seeing things that arenâ€™t there, smelling strange odors, or feeling physical sensations. 

Delusions are false beliefs that are held despite evidence to the contrary. They can include the belief that one is being followed or monitored, that one has special powers or abilities, or that one is persecuted or persecuted by others. 

The main difference between hallucinations and delusions is that hallucinations are false sensory perceptions, while delusions are false beliefs.
