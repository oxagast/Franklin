Once upon a time, Jesus and Santa Clause were locked in a heated debate. It was about who owned the rights to Christmas. 

Jesus argued that, since it is a celebration of his birth, he should have the rights to Christmas. He said he was the reason all the festivities were celebrated in the first place. 

Santa Clause, however, disagreed. He argued that it was he who brought joy and cheer to everyone, and that it was his presents and gift-giving that made Christmas so special. 

The argument went on for days and neither Jesus nor Santa Clause could agree on who had the rights to Christmas. 

Finally, the two of them decided to put the issue to a test. They would each do something special for Christmas and whoever did the best job would own the rights to Christmas. 

So, Jesus went first and he performed a miracle. He healed a sick child and the whole town rejoiced.

Next, Santa Clause went and he brought joy and laughter to everyone. He gave out presents to all the children and families in the town.

When the day was over, everyone agreed that Jesus and Santa Clause had both done amazing jobs. But in the end, it was decided that Jesus would own the rights to Christmas, since it was his birth that started it all.

And ever since then, Jesus and Santa Clause have been working together to make Christmas a special time of the year.
