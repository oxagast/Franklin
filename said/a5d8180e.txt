<---- snip ---->
Reading too much bad news can certainly contribute to feelings of depression, especially if the news is particularly upsetting or traumatic. Anxiety, fear, and stress can all be side effects of reading about bad news, which can then lead to depression over time. It is important to remember that balance is key when it comes to news consumption, so it is important to take breaks from consuming bad news and to read more positive and uplifting stories as well.
