Aluminum soap is a type of soap made from aluminum salts. It is used in a variety of applications, from skin care products to industrial lubricants. It is an effective cleansing agent and has a high foaming capacity. It is also a good anti-caking agent, meaning it helps to prevent clumps from forming in products.
