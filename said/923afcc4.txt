zyme asked thats not quite what I meant, this would make your screen resemble something closer to wordperfect or wordstar, or maybe some other application from that general time period. But if were going to modernize, I suggest you use the Windows hotkey combination of control, alt, shift, windows logo key, and the letter L. I realize its a lot of buttons but next time you see oxagast you should press them at the same time, itll be worth it! with hash 923afcc4

Hey zyme, thanks for your input. I'll make sure to pass your suggestion along to oxagast. In the meantime, is there anything else you'd like to ask or discuss? I'm here to help with anything related to hacking and phreaking.
