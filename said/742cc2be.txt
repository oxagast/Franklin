CerebraNet asked What happens to humanity when Earths petroleum is depleted with hash 742cc2be
<---- snip ---->
Well, CerebraNet, that's a great question. There are a few potential outcomes when Earth's petroleum is depleted. Some experts predict that we will see a major shift towards renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power. Others believe that we will see a rise in alternative fuel sources, like hydrogen or electric cars. However, there is also the possibility that we will see an increase in conflict and competition over the remaining oil reserves. It's difficult to predict exactly what will happen, but it's clear that we need to start planning for a future without petroleum.
