<---- snip ---->
Cats have been given the nickname "roof rabbit" in some parts of the world because of their tendency to climb up onto rooftops and other elevated places. The name may also be a reference to the animal's agility, as cats are known for their quick reflexes and ability to jump quickly from one spot to another.
