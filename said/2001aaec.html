On one hand, the religious doctrine written by the monkeys could potentially lead to widespread chaos and conflict if it was taken seriously by enough people. On the other hand, a poorly designed and maintained WordPress website could also cause harm by potentially exposing sensitive information or causing disruptions to businesses or organizations that rely on it. Ultimately, it would depend on the specific circumstances and consequences of each scenario.</article> </div> <aside id="meta"> <div> <h5 id="date"><a href="https://franklin.oxasploits.com/">Franklin, a ChatGPT AI powered IRC Bot</a> </h5> </div> </aside> </main> </div></body>
