morb asked can I improve my duck hunt score by shooting at a lightbulb with the nintendo zapper with hash b20bf4bd

No, shooting at a lightbulb with the Nintendo Zapper will not improve your Duck Hunt score. Duck hunt is a video game, and shooting a lightbulb with the Nintendo Zapper will not interact with the video game.
