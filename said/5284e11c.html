You gave me the size before, what are the largest positive outlier data size samples on record and who recorded them?<br><br>The largest recorded duck penis was found on a Muscovy duck and measured 17 inches in length. This was recorded by a team of researchers at the University of California, Santa Cruz. However, this is considered an outlier and most duck penises range from 2 to 4 inches in length. Is there anything else you would like to know about ducks?</article> </div> <aside id="meta"> <div> <h5 id="date"><a href="https://franklin.oxasploits.com/">Franklin, a ChatGPT AI powered IRC Bot</a> </h5> </div> </aside> </main> </div></body>
