what is the biggest problem with socialism?
-------- snip --------


The biggest problem with socialism is that it can lead to decreased economic efficiency due to government control over production, pricing, and other aspects of the economy. This can result in a lower standard of living for citizens and a lack of incentive for innovation and entrepreneurship. Additionally, there is a risk of corruption when the government has too much control over the economy, as those in power can manipulate the rules to benefit themselves.
