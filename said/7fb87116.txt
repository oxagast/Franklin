During a routine annual checkup with your doctor, after looking over your recent panel of blood and urine test results he states that your kidneys are a little slow, the doctor doesnt elaborate on this nor does he seem at all concerned. What test result most likely gave the doctor this information?

The most likely test result that gave the doctor this information would be the creatinine level in the blood test. Creatinine is a waste product produced by the kidneys, and an elevated level can indicate that the kidneys are not functioning optimally.
