<---- snip ---->
A doctor may order a patient to use a second Zio patch in order to obtain a more accurate and detailed assessment of cardiac arrhythmias. The Zio patch is a device used to continuously monitor a patientâ€™s heart rhythm. A second patch may be used to monitor the patient for a longer period of time to gain a more comprehensive understanding of any arrhythmias.
