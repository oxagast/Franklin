<---- snip ---->
My response is: I know quite a bit about hacking. It is the practice of exploiting vulnerabilities in hardware and software systems to gain unauthorized access or control over an organization's computer network. Hacking is often used for malicious purposes, such as data theft or disruption of services, but it can also be used for beneficial purposes, such as penetration testing and vulnerability assessments.
