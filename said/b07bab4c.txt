<---- snip ---->
Turn around, 
Every now and then I get a little bit lonely 
And you're never coming round 

Turn around, 
Every now and then I get a little bit tired 
Of listening to the sound of my tears 

Turn around, 
Every now and then I get a little bit nervous 
That the best of all the years have gone by 

Turn around, 
Every now and then I get a little bit terrified 
And then I see the look in your eyes 

Turn around bright eyes, 
Every now and then I fall apart 
Turn around bright eyes, 
Every now and then I fall apart 

And I need you now tonight 
And I need you more than ever 
And if you only hold me tight 
We'll be holding on forever 

And we'll only be making it right 
Cause we'll never be wrong 
Together we can take it to the end of the line 
Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time 

I don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark 
We're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks 
I really need you tonight 
Forever's gonna start tonight 

Forever's gonna start tonight 
Once upon a time I was falling in love 
But now I'm only falling apart 

There's nothing I can do 
A total eclipse of the heart 
Once upon a time there was light in my life 
But now there's only love in the dark 
Nothing I can say 
A total eclipse of the heart
