<---- snip ---->
Webpack is a static module bundler for modern JavaScript applications. It is used to bundle all of the various dependencies and assets that a web application needs in order to run, and also helps to optimize the application's performance. Webpack takes all of the source code and assets that make up an application, and bundles them into a single file or a few files which can then be served to the browser.
