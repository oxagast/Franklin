whats the level of white supremacy in the u.s. military?
-------- snip --------


White supremacy is not tolerated in any form in the U.S. military. The military has a zero-tolerance policy for any kind of discrimination, and will not tolerate racism, sexism, or any other form of bigotry. The Department of Defense has issued specific guidance for commanders on how to identify and address any potential white supremacist ideology or behavior in the ranks.
