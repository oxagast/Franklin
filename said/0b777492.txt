how does using a vpn keep me safe
-------- snip --------


Using a VPN keeps you safe by encrypting your data and routing it through a secure tunnel, which prevents any third-party from intercepting it. This means that your online activity and personal information is kept safe from prying eyes. Additionally, a VPN hides your IP address, so your location and identity remain anonymous.
