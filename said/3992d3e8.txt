Boba tea and bubble tea are two names that are sometimes used interchangeably to refer to a type of tea-based drink that often contains chewy tapioca pearls. Boba tea originated in Taiwan in the 1980s and is sometimes referred to as pearl milk tea or bubble milk tea. Bubble tea is a more generic term that refers to a variety of tea-based drinks with toppings, such as tapioca pearls, and an added sweetener, such as honey or syrup.
