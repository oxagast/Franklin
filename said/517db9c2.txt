Yes, it is possible that these people had low scores but were not in any financial distress. Credit scores are only one indicator of a person's financial health and can be affected by a variety of factors. Other indicators, such as income level, savings, and debt-to-income ratio, may be more reliable indicators of a person's financial health.
