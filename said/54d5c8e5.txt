<---- snip ---->
According to a study by the University of Florida, vinegar is actually more effective at catching flies than honey. The researchers found that flies were attracted to the smell of vinegar more than honey, and were more likely to land on vinegar-coated surfaces. However, both honey and vinegar can be effective at catching flies, so it ultimately depends on personal preference.
