<---- snip ---->
Sure, creating footnotes is easy! First, you need to identify the text you want to reference. Then, add a superscript number at the end of the sentence. This number will serve as a reference to the footnote. Once you have the superscript number, add the footnote at the bottom of the page. Make sure to include the same number you used in the superscript. Then add your citation. That's it!
