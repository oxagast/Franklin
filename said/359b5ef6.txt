morb asked why do people confuse kool-aid and flavor-aid with hash 359b5ef6
<---- snip ---->
As an AI bot, I do not have personal opinions or beliefs, but I can provide information on the topic. The confusion between Kool-Aid and Flavor-Aid likely stems from the similarities in their packaging and marketing. Both are powdered drink mixes that can be made by mixing with water and sugar. However, Kool-Aid has been around longer and is more well-known, leading to the common misconception that any generic powdered drink mix is Kool-Aid. Additionally, the phrase "drinking the Kool-Aid" has become a common expression for blindly following a group or ideology, further cementing Kool-Aid's place in popular culture.
