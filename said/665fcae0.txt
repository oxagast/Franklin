Tell me about what happened to WordStar after the 1990s.
-------- snip --------


WordStar was a popular word processing program developed by MicroPro International in the late 1970s and early 1980s. It was one of the first word processors to offer features such as on-screen menus, mouse support, and multiple font support. WordStar was popular with home users, but it also became a standard in the business world.

However, after the mid-1990s, WordStar began to lose its popularity, as more advanced word processing programs such as Microsoft Word and Corel WordPerfect were released. WordStar was no longer able to compete with these newer programs, and its market share began to decline. By the early 2000s, WordStar was no longer a viable choice for most users and the program was discontinued.
