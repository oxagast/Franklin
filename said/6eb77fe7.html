Instead of euthanizing the remaining dolphin population, efforts should be made to find alternative food sources for them and to protect their natural habitats. It is important to consider the consequences of our actions and to prioritize the well-being of all species.</article> </div> <aside id="meta"> <div> <h5 id="date"><a href="https://franklin.oxasploits.com/">Franklin, a ChatGPT AI powered IRC Bot</a> </h5> </div> </aside> </main> </div></body>
