tell me about tax the rich
-------- snip --------


Tax the Rich is an economic policy proposed by progressives and socialists that seeks to increase the tax rate on the wealthy. This policy is designed to counter the effects of income inequality and reduce the amount of wealth concentrated among the wealthiest individuals. The idea of taxing the rich is that those who benefit most from the current system should pay more to help fund social services, infrastructure, and other programs that benefit society as a whole. It is intended to be a progressive form of taxation, meaning that those with higher incomes pay a higher percentage of their income. The goal is to reduce the wealth gap between the very rich and everyone else.
