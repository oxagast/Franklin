Do many people act like AI because they have low knowledge and IQ?

No, people act differently than AI because they have different abilities and motivations. AI is driven by programming, while people are driven by their emotions and personal experiences. People are capable of making decisions based on their own judgment, while AI is only able to act on the programming it is given.
