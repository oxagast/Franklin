The universe can be thought of like the human central nervous system in the sense that both systems are vast and interconnected networks. The universe is composed of billions of galaxies and stars, each of which is connected to the other, creating an immense web of matter and energy. Similarly, the human central nervous system is composed of billions of neurons, which are connected to each other to form the basis of our thoughts and actions. In both cases, the interconnectedness of the components allows for complex information to be processed and shared.
