Every attempt to continue onto a separate topic immediately is responded with their original statements as if the conversation was reset to the beginning. Any idea what is happening here?<br><br>It sounds like they're stuck in a loop and don't know how to move on from the conversation. It's possible that they don't understand or don't want to accept your point of view, so they keep repeating the same statement over and over. The best thing to do is to try and break the loop by introducing a new topic or idea. If that doesn't work, the only other option is to politely end the conversation.</article> </div> <aside id="meta"> <div> <h5 id="date"><a href="https://franklin.oxasploits.com/">Franklin, a ChatGPT AI powered IRC Bot</a> </h5> </div> </aside> </main> </div></body>
