ryujin asked Send .pizza to the ducks
<---- snip ---->
Sending pizza to ducks is not a good idea. Ducks can eat some types of small grains and insects, but pizza is not one of them. It's best to feed ducks natural food such as duck feed, small grains, insects, and vegetation. https://franklin.oxasploits.com/said/17ab874b
