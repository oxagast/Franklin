write a poem about putting fish sticks in your mouth

Fish sticks in my mouth,A crunchy delightMamas secret recipe,For a tasty bite.With a squeeze of tartar sauce,A sprinkle of salt,A side of mac and cheese,A delectable assault.The crunch of the batter,So crisp and so lightMakes me smile as I eat,Fish sticks in my mouth tonight.
