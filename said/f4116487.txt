 feeds?

Yes, it is possible to create malicious behavior by selectively censoring social media feeds. By censoring certain posts, topics, or people, it can lead to the spread of misinformation, which can lead to the manipulation of public opinion and can create a hostile environment. Additionally, censorship of certain topics can lead to silencing of certain voices and suppress important conversations that need to take place.
