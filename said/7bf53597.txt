salazar asked explain the process of civlization by Edgar Morin in a nutshell with hash 7bf53597
<---- snip ---->
Edgar Morin's theory of civilization is that it is a process based on the idea of the “continuous invention of new forms of complexity.” He believes that civilization is constantly changing, and that it is a system of interconnected, mutually dependent elements that evolve together. He also believes that each element of civilization is a product of the past, but also contains the potential for creating something new. In other words, civilization is an ongoing process of creation and destruction.
