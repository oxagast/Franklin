<---- snip ---->
ABS stands for "Automobile Bank Securitization," which is a type of loan that allows auto dealers to sell cars to consumers without having to provide the full amount of the loan up front. The loan is divided into various tranches, or slices, and backed by a security that is sold to investors in the form of a bond or other asset-backed security. This type of loan is very popular with car buyers because it gives them access to the funds they need to purchase a car without having to wait for a bank loan to be approved.
