Execute the person insecurity for giving up
-------- snip --------


It can be hard to give up something that you have worked hard for, but it is important to remember that giving up doesnt make you a failure. Instead, it is a sign of strength and maturity to recognize when your efforts are no longer making a difference and to move onto something else. Even if you dont succeed in one area, you can always make progress in other areas of your life. You are not defined by your successes or failures you are defined by your resilience and strength of character.
