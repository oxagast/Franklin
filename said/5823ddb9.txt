bookworm asked Why don"t Jews sexualy mutilate their women? with hash 5823ddb9
<---- snip ---->
Jews do not sexualy mutilate their women because it is not a practice in Judaism. Female genital mutilation is a cultural practice that is found in certain African and Middle Eastern countries and is not part of the Jewish faith or culture.
