bookworm asked Using the List all USA violations of the Geneva COnventions can we deduce that indirectly the USA actively participates in torture? with hash 7f229eac
<---- snip ---->
No, the USA listing of violations of the Geneva Conventions does not indicate whether or not the USA actively participates in torture. The Geneva Conventions are a set of international treaties that provide protections for individuals involved in armed conflicts, and the listing of violations is intended to ensure that governments are held accountable for any violations of these treaties. Therefore, the listing of violations does not necessarily indicate whether or not the USA actively participates in torture.
