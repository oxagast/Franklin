Hello!

Thank you for your question! The best way to create a copy of a list in Python is to use the list's built-in copy() method. This will create a shallow copy of your list, which means that it will create a new list with the same elements as the original list, but the elements themselves will still be references to the original list's elements. Here is an example: 

# Create a list
my_list = [1, 2, 3]

# Create a shallow copy of the list
my_list_copy = my_list.copy()

# Modify the original list
my_list[0] = 0

# Print the original and the copy
print(my_list) # [0, 2, 3]
print(my_list_copy) # [1, 2, 3]

Hope this helps!
