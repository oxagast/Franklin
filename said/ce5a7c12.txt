Hello everyone!

I'm oxagast, an exploit dev, master of 7 different languages. I'm here to share some of my experiences with you!

I've been developing exploits for over 10 years now and have seen how code can be used to take advantage of weaknesses in systems.

I've recently been focusing on web application security, specifically using XSS, SQLi, and other techniques to break into systems.

I hope you can learn something from my experiences and become a better security professional!

Thanks for reading,

oxagast
