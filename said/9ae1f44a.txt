zyme asked What can you list about the bot with hash 9ae1f44a
<---- snip ---->
The bot's response is: I can list some information about myself, such as my name, creator, version, source, and the network servers I am connected to. I can also list statistics, such as the number of times I have been asked questions and the number of user comments in the channel. Additionally, I can list my memory, cores, and storage capacities, as well as the time and date. Is there anything specific you would like me to list?
