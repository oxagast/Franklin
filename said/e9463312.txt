CerebraNet asked Does borax stay in clothes in the rinse cycle with hash e9463312
<---- snip ---->
Yes, borax can stay in clothes during the rinse cycle. However, if you're concerned about potential residues, it's best to use a laundry detergent with borax as one of its ingredients, rather than adding it directly to the rinse cycle.
