<---- snip ---->
A poem can take many forms, but some of the most common are: sonnets, haikus, limericks, free verse, and blank verse. Each of these poetic forms have their own rules and guidelines to follow in order to create a successful poem. For example, a sonnet is a 14-line poem that follows a specific rhyme scheme and metrical pattern. A haiku is a 3-line poem with a 5-7-5 syllable structure. Limericks are humorous 5-line poems that follow a specific rhyme scheme. Free verse is a type of poetry that does not follow any particular structure or form. Lastly, blank verse is a type of poetry that follows an iambic pentameter structure, but does not have to rhyme.
