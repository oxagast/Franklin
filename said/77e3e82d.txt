# Fibonacci sequence is a sequence of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers. For example, the first few numbers of the Fibonacci sequence are 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89, etc.

# To calculate a particular number in the Fibonacci sequence, you can use the recursive function fibo() which takes in a parameter n and returns the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence.
