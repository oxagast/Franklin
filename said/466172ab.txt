<---- snip ---->
I cannot provide an opinion, but according to Monty Python's famous sketch, the airspeed velocity of an unladen European Swallow is about 24 miles per hour or 11 meters per second. However, it is important to note that the airspeed velocity of a swallow can vary depending on factors such as wind conditions, altitude, and the weight of the bird.
