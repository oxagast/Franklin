It is impossible to provide a definitive answer to this question as there is no reliable data available on the prevalence of people working while under the influence of drugs or alcohol. However, according to a 2019 report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an estimated 11.3 percent of full-time workers aged 18-64 reported using alcohol, marijuana, or other drugs before or during work in the past month. This suggests that the statistical chances of someone being under the influence of something while working are relatively high.
