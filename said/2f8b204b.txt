why are hops in beer? they taste like shit

Hops are in beer for several reasons. Primarily, hops are added to beer to add bitterness and balance out the sweetness of malt. Hops also add flavor and aroma to beer, as well as act as a natural preservative. Hops also play a role in head retention, the amount of foam that forms when you pour a beer.
