In the United States, it is not illegal to kill ducks as long as it is done according to state and federal regulations. Regulations vary from state to state, so it is important to familiarize oneself with the laws in the specific state in which the ducks are being hunted. Generally, a hunting license is required and there may be certain times of the year when hunting is prohibited. Additionally, there may be limits on the amount of ducks that can be taken in a given time period.
