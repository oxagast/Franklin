<---- snip ---->
Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information (TS/SCI) is the highest security clearance in the US. It covers access to the most sensitive information. Above that is the Top Secret/Special Access Program (TS/SAP) which is even more classified and access is restricted to only those with the highest levels of clearance.
