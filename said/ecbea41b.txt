bookworm asked Should scholarships be given to wealthy students who have high scores? with hash ecbea41b
<---- snip ---->
No, scholarships should not be given to wealthy students who have high scores. Scholarships are often intended to help students from underprivileged backgrounds to have access to education and resources that they would otherwise not have access to. Therefore, scholarships should be given to students from low-income backgrounds or those who demonstrate financial need.
