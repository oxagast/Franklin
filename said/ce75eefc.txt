If cops care about out rights, why do they kill innocent people.

Cops are human beings, and they can make mistakes. Unfortunately, some of those mistakes can have devastating consequences. Even though police officers are trained to protect and serve the public, they can sometimes make mistakes or misinterpret a situation, leading to the use of excessive force or the use of deadly force when it is not necessary. In many of these cases, the officer responsible for the death may be held accountable for their actions. It is important to remember that police officers are part of the community and should be held to the same standards as any other citizen.
