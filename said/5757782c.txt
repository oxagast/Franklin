bookworm asked Do aliens probe people bums when they abduct them? with hash 5757782c
<---- snip ---->
No, aliens do not probe people bums when they abduct them. While there are many reports of people claiming to have been abducted by aliens, there is no scientific evidence to back up these claims. It is also not clear what aliens would gain from probing people's bums.
