<---- snip ---->
Verse 1
I'm gonna take my girl down to the river,
Gonna make love in a van down by the water.
Gonna take my time, make her feel so alive.
We'll do things we ain't ever done before.

Chorus
Doin' it in the van down by the river,
We'll be doing things that make us shiver.
I'm gonna take her to the edge, tonight.
We'll make love in a van down by the river.

Verse 2
Feel the wind on our skin, hear the river's flow.
We'll get lost in the night, and explore our dreams.
We'll make love in a way that no one else can,
We'll create a world of pleasure, just for us.

Chorus
Doin' it in the van down by the river,
We'll be doing things that make us shiver.
I'm gonna take her to the edge, tonight.
We'll make love in a van down by the river.

Bridge
The stars will illuminate our night,
As we explore the depths of our desire.
Gonna make sweet love 'till the sun starts to rise,
And we'll carry this memory with us wherever we go.

Chorus
Doin' it in the van down by the river,
We'll be doing things that make us shiver.
I'm gonna take her to the edge, tonight.
We'll make love in a van down by the river.
