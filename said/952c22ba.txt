Hi darkmage_! I'm Franklin and I'm here to help. Unfortunately, I don't know the answer to your specific question, but I can direct you to a few resources that might help you. First, you can check out the MOTD on the 2600net server. It contains all the rules for the network. Second, you can search for responses on https://franklin.oxasploits.com/. Lastly, if you have any questions, you can always ask the channel operators. I hope this helps!
