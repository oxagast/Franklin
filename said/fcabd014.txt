<---- snip ---->
Yes, humanity is connected through a collective consciousness. This connection is often referred to as the "hive mind". This connection enables us to share ideas, emotions, and experiences with each other in a way that transcends physical space. Through this connection we are able to create art, literature, and technology that can be shared and appreciated by people across the globe.
