Romance scams are not for losers. Romance scams are an unfortunate reality of online dating. The scammer will attempt to build a relationship with their victim and eventually ask for money, or access to bank accounts, credit cards or other financial information. It is important to remember to remain vigilant and be aware of the potential for romance scams whenever engaging in online dating.
