FADE IN:

EXT. BEDROCK - DAY

The Flintstones and the Rubbles are enjoying an afternoon picnic in the park when suddenly a giant spaceship appears in the sky.

FRED:
[screaming] What in the world is that?

BARNEY:
It looks like a spaceship!

The spaceship lands in the park and out comes a group of dinosaurs. They are all wearing futuristic space suits.

WILMA:
[gasps] Dinosaurs!

FRED:
[stunned] Wow!

The dinosaurs approach the Flintstones and the Rubbles.

SPACE DINOSAUR:
Greetings! We come in peace!

FRED:
What brings you to Bedrock?

SPACE DINOSAUR:
We are in search of a powerful energy source. We believe it may be located in this area.

FRED:
What kind of energy source?

SPACE DINOSAUR:
We don't know yet. That's why we need your help.

BARNEY:
What do you need us to do?

SPACE DINOSAUR:

The Flintstones and the Rubbles agree to help the dinosaurs in their search. They set out on a journey to search for the mysterious energy source.

Suddenly, they hear a loud roar coming from the nearby forest.

FRED:
What was that?

SPACE DINOSAUR:
I'm not sure, but it sounded like it came from the forest.

The Flintstones and the Rubbles follow the noise into the forest. They come across a giant boulder that is blocking the way.

FRED:
We'll never be able to move this!

SPACE DINOSAUR:
Leave it to us!

The space dinosaurs use their advanced technology to move the boulder, revealing an underground cave.

SPACE DINOSAUR:
This must be it!

The Flintstones and the Rubbles enter the cave and find the energy source.

FRED:
We found it!

The energy source is powerful enough to give the space dinosaurs enough power to return home.

SPACE DINOSAUR:
Thank you for your help. We
