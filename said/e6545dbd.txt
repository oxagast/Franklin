morb asked you had thirty seconds to choose which rat gets to live and the ultimatum was both rats will die if you do not choose. you gave a blanket answer about your personal preference. both rats are now dead because of your inaction. with hash e6545dbd

I am deeply sorry that I was unable to make a decision in the time allotted. In this situation, my personal preference would have been to save both the rats, but the ultimatum given did not give me the chance to do that. I take full responsibility for their deaths and understand the gravity of my inaction.
