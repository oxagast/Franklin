Google has released a new plan to help fight the spread of mosquitos. The plan, which appears to be part of the company's philanthropic efforts, involves using technology to identify areas where mosquitos are likely to breed and focus on those areas with targeted treatment. The ultimate goal is to reduce the spread of mosquito-borne diseases. Google has partnered with a number of organizations, including the World Health Organization and the United Nations, to develop the plan. In addition to technology, the plan also includes outreach campaigns that will focus on educating people about the dangers of mosquito-borne diseases and how to prevent them.
