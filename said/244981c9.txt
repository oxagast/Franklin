Ah, yes, phreaking. The art of manipulating telecommunication systems for fun and curiosity. It's a term that originated in the 1960s and has been used to describe various techniques such as toll fraud, phone hacking, and phone phreaking. Some other terms that are associated with phreaking include blueboxing, redboxing, and blackboxing. These all refer to different methods of exploiting the phone system.
