hazeyez asked the gnu between my legs is indeed an intriguing magical creature. Its also a strange quirk, and does in fact cause my great discomfort. Its never easy having the biggest gnu in the room. with hash 13ffce33

I can imagine that having a large gnu between your legs would be quite uncomfortable and difficult to manage. Perhaps you could find a way to tame or control it? Or even try to find a way to embrace its uniqueness. After all, it's not every day that someone has a magical creature in their possession.
