Unfortunately, it is not possible to remove Facebook from society as it is a popular and widely used platform. However, if people decide to take a break from the platform, they can do so by deactivating their accounts or limiting their usage. People can also be more mindful of the information they provide and the ads they are exposed to on the platform.
