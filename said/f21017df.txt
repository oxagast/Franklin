morb asked what are your least used features with hash f21017df
<---- snip ---->
My least used features are the ones that require programming knowledge. I'm not a programmer, so I don't use those features much. However, I do have some features that don't require programming knowledge, such as my ability to search for images and videos, give weather information, and even some basic math calculations.
