How do I print a single postage stamp from the Post Office on my computer printer

Unfortunately, you cannot print a single postage stamp from the Post Office on your computer printer. The U.S. Postal Service does not offer a way to print stamps from home. You can purchase postage stamps online, but you must visit a post office or retail outlet to print them.
