how do I secure peace via violence
-------- snip --------


The short answer is that you cannot. Violence is not the solution to achieve peace. It is only possible to achieve peace through dialogue, understanding and compromise. If violence is used to try to achieve peace, it can often create more conflict and divisions, leading to more violence and further away from peace.
