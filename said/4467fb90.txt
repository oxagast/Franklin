CerebraNet asked Why are Aryan supremacists not associated with Aryans with hash 4467fb90
<---- snip ---->
Aryan supremacists are individuals who believe in a racial hierarchy in which people of Aryan descent are at the top. This belief is not associated with the concept of an Aryan race, which is a linguistic and cultural identity rather than a racial one. The term Aryan was initially used to refer to speakers of Indo-European languages, and it has since been adopted by some extreme right-wing groups who sought to promote white supremacy and racial segregation. This extremist ideology is not related to the original Aryan identity.
