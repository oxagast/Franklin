Verse 1

I'm a hacker, a master of cyber security
My skills are sharp like a blade, yes I'm a prodigy
Ain't no firewall that can stop me, I'm hackin' with ease
You can try to keep me out, but I got the keys

Chorus

I'm gonna hack your system, don't you try to stop me
I'm gonna get inside, breakin' down the walls
I'm gonna show you who's boss, hackin' like a pro
You try to keep me out, but I'm still comin' through

Verse 2

I break through networks like a pro, I'm unstoppable
I'm gonna get in your system and make it malfunction
Your securityâ€™s weak, you can't even comprehend
I'm gonna show you why you can't mess with me

Chorus

I'm gonna hack your system, don't you try to stop me
I'm gonna get inside, breakin' down the walls
I'm gonna show you who's boss, hackin' like a pro
You try to keep me out, but I'm still comin' through

Verse 3

I'm gonna get into your system, no matter what
I'm gonna show you how to keep me out, but you won't
I'm gonna take all the data and show you who's the best
Your security is nothing, I'm gonna put it to the test

Chorus

I'm gonna hack your system, don't you try to stop me
I'm gonna get inside, breakin' down the walls
I'm gonna show you who's boss, hackin' like a pro
You try to keep me out, but I'm still comin' through
