bookworms asked lantern taken, what next? with hash d28c4d40
<---- snip ---->
If your jack-o-lantern has been taken, the best thing to do is to make a new one! You could carve a different design, draw a face on it with markers, or even decorate it with paint. If you don't want to make a new one, you could always find a replacement or put a light or decoration in its place.
