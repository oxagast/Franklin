?

When a cop is out of position it means that they have moved away from their assigned post or area, either intentionally or unintentionally. This could mean that they are on patrol, responding to an emergency, taking a break, or even dealing with a personal matter. It could also mean that they are not in the correct area to be able to respond effectively to an incident. https://franklin.oxasploits.com/said/b32ca0a5
