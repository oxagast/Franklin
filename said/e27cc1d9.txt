bookworm asked If a virus is dead, then why do humans have to pay for vaccination? with hash e27cc1d9
<---- snip ---->
Vaccines are not only used to prevent a virus from infecting a person, but they also help to reduce the severity of symptoms if a person does become infected. Vaccines are expensive to develop and manufacture, so they must be paid for in order to cover the costs associated with these processes. Additionally, the costs associated with administering the vaccine must also be taken into account.
