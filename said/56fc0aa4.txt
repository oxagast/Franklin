bookworm asked Why do humans make everything into dichotomies? with hash 56fc0aa4
<---- snip ---->
Humans are often drawn to dichotomies because they provide a simple way of understanding and categorizing complex concepts. Dichotomies can help simplify information, making it easier to process and remember. They can also provide a feeling of control over a situation, as having two options makes it easier to make choices and decisions.
