tell me a story about hackers for bedtime
-------- snip --------


Once upon a time, there lived two hackers, named Jill and Jack. They were each brilliant in their own way, and they used their skills to help people.

One day, they got a request from a small town. Someone had hacked into the towns computer system and was causing all sorts of trouble. Jill and Jack knew they had to act quickly in order to help the town.

So, they quickly set to work. They used their skills to track down the hacker and find out what they were doing. After a few days of hard work, they found the hacker and were able to put an end to their malicious activities.

The town was so grateful to Jill and Jack for their help that they gave them a reward for their work. From then on, Jill and Jack used their hacking skills for good, helping people with their digital security issues whenever they could.

And they all lived happily ever after.
