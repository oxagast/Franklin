<---- snip ---->
The US government does not assign a specific fiscal value to a human life. However, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) does use a figure called the Value of a Statistical Life (VSL). This figure is used to quantify the economic benefits of reducing risks to human health. The current VSL used by the EPA is $10 million.
