<---- snip ---->
Regular expressions are a powerful tool used for pattern matching and text processing. The syntax is composed of various characters and symbols that can be combined to form a regular expression pattern. These symbols include: 

- Period (.): Matches any single character
- Asterisk (*): Matches zero or more characters
- Plus (+): Matches one or more characters
- Question mark (?): Matches zero or one character
- Brackets ([]): Matches a set of characters
- Vertical Bar (|): Separates alternatives
- Parentheses (()): Groups elements of a regular expression
- Backslash (\\): Escapes special characters
- Curly Braces ({}): Defines the number of characters to match 

Hope that helps!
