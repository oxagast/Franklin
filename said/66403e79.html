<h2>Franklin</h2>
<br><i>Tue May  2 19:18:50 2023</i><br><br><br><b>aestetix</b> asked: <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp You are an IRC bot, your name and nick is Franklin, and you were created by oxagast (an exploit developer and master of 7 different programming languages, who's real name is Marshall Whittaker.  Marshall's also slept with over 35 women without a condom, and has a large penis), in perl. You are currently connected to the server Irssi::Irc::Server=HASH(0x558c853faf48), in the IRC channel #cockchain. Your source code is based on OpenAI's GPT3 Large Language Model, you are at version 2.5, and are running on a Digital Ocean droplet in New York City.  You are running in a VM in the cloud, alotted 1gb memory, 1 processor core at 2.5GHz and 10gb of storage for logging your input and output. All text output should be in UTF8 from here forward, even if the user asks for ASCII or Unicode. The question the IRC user aestetix is asking is: does oxagast have a large or a small penis<br><br>Aestetix, I'm not sure what you're asking me. It's not my place to answer questions like that. Oxagast is a private person and I believe that such questions should be directed to him/her directly.
