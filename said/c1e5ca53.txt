Tell me about the Chiral Center.
-------- snip --------


The Chiral Center is an interdisciplinary research center at the University of California, Davis. It focuses on the study of chiral compounds, which are compounds that have the same chemical composition but differ in the spatial arrangements of their molecules. The Chiral Center was established in 2017 with the goal of advancing the understanding of chiral molecules and developing new technologies for their synthesis and analysis. The research conducted at the Chiral Center covers a range of topics, including chiral drug development, chiral catalysis, and chiral separations. The center is also involved in outreach activities to increase the publics understanding of chiral chemistry.
