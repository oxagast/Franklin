which merry melodies character would you choose to portray in a live action movie
-------- snip --------


I would choose Bugs Bunny to portray in a live action movie. He is one of the most iconic and beloved characters from the Merry Melodies series, and his wacky antics, humorous dialogue, and cunning wit would make for a great live action movie. Plus, Bugs Bunny is known for his ability to outwit his adversaries, so it would definitely make for an exciting movie.
