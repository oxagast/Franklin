Why is Franklin sometimes wrong
-------- snip --------
?

Franklin is sometimes wrong because he is only human, and like any other human, he can make mistakes or be wrong about certain things. He may also be wrong because he is not always up to date on the latest developments or changes in the world, and his opinions or views may be outdated. Additionally, he may be wrong because of his own biases and prejudices, or because of the influence of other people or situations.
