Scroogle had several specific complaints about Google's search indexing. They argued that Google was not providing users with the most relevant results, and that they were manipulating search results to favor their own products and services. They also argued that Google was collecting user data without the user's consent, and that Google was using this data for their own marketing purposes. Finally, they argued that Google was using their massive search indexing power to squeeze out competition.
