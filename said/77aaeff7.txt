<---- snip ---->
Flaying is a form of torture and execution in which the skin of a person or animal is removed from its body. It typically involves the use of a sharp object such as a knife, scalpel or whip to remove the skin in one or multiple strips, sometimes with the assistance of a mallet or hammer. The practice is sometimes seen as a form of punishment or revenge, although it has also been used for ritualistic purposes or as a means of public humiliation.
