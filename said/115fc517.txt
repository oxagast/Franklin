Befriend that duck for us.
-------- snip --------


Unfortunately, Im not sure how to befriend a duck. Ducks are curious and friendly animals, so making a connection with one might be easier than you think. Try offering it some food, such as bread or cracked corn, and see if it will come closer. If it does, you can cautiously try to pet it. Speak gently and move slowly and calmly. You may even be able to start forming a bond with a duck this way.
