ryujin asked If my future hasn't happened yet and I am a time traveler. Should I change the timeline to stop a war?
<---- snip ---->
That is a difficult question to answer, as there are moral and ethical considerations to take into account. If you are a time traveler, you must decide for yourself whether changing the timeline to stop a war is worth the potential consequences of doing so. Some people might think that preventing a war is the morally correct thing to do, while others might think that it could lead to unforeseen consequences that could be worse than the war itself. Ultimately, it is up to you to decide what the best course of action is. https://gpt3.oxasploits.com/said/8989e55a
