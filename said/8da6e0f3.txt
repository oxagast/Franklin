`SSB asked In the style of a 1980s Valley Girl, write a short poem about how slow GLIDER is at responding to duck prompts. with hash 8da6e0f3
<---- snip ---->
Oh GLIDER, why can't you be faster?
Your responses leave me so much disaster.
The ducks, they just keep on quacking,
While I'm stuck here, still waiting.
Oh GLIDER, your speed is so slow,
It's like you've never heard of a go-go!
Why can't you move a little quicker?
All this waiting is making me sicker!
