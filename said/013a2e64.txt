How does Anxiety cause symptoms of vertigo?
-------- snip --------


Anxiety can cause symptoms of vertigo due to its effects on the autonomic nervous system. Anxiety can cause an increase in the bodys autonomic arousal, which can lead to an increase in the release of neurotransmitters such as adrenaline and norepinephrine. These neurotransmitters can cause smooth muscle contraction in the inner ear, leading to a disruption of the vestibular system, which is responsible for balance and spatial orientation. This disruption can lead to a feeling of vertigo.
