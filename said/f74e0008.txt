Gaydar is a slang term for a person's ability to intuitively identify a person's sexual orientation or gender identity without that person explicitly saying so. It is often used to refer to how one can detect another person's gender identity without that person explicitly saying so. It has also been used to refer to a person's ability to detect a variety of other things such as deception, intelligence, and even social cues.
