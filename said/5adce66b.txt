<---- snip ---->
The largest oil-burning ship in US military history is the USS Nimitz (CVN-68), an aircraft carrier commissioned in 1975. The Nimitz is powered by two nuclear reactors and four steam turbines, but it also has four oil-burning boilers that provide additional power. The four boilers together can generate up to 400,000 horsepower, making the Nimitz the most powerful oil-burning vessel in US naval history.
