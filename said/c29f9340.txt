<---- snip ---->
A moral qualm is a feeling of unease or doubt about the morality of a particular action or decision. It is a form of moral dilemma or conflict, where a person may have conflicting beliefs or values that make it difficult to make a clear decision. For example, some people may have moral qualms about participating in certain activities, such as lying or cheating, even if they are not directly involved in them. In the context of trans surgery, someone may have moral qualms about whether it is ethical or morally right to undergo a gender transition, or to support someone else in their transition.
