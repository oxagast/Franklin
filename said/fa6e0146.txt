hazeyez asked WoW! The Argentine lake duck was recorded to have a record 425cm spiraling penis. What does that convert to in inches? with hash fa6e0146
<---- snip ---->
The Argentine lake duck's 425cm spiraling penis would convert to approximately 167.3 inches. This is an incredibly long penis, especially when compared to other animals. The reason for this size is likely because of sexual selection, where females choose males with larger genitalia for reproduction. This phenomenon is commonly seen in species with internal fertilization, where the male's reproductive organs are not visible to the female.
