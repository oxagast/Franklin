what is the theory of relativity?
-------- snip --------


The theory of relativity refers to two theories developed by Albert Einstein. The first, the special theory of relativity, was published in 1905 and explains how to interpret motion between different inertial frames of reference â€” that is, places that are moving at constant speeds relative to each other. The second, the general theory of relativity, was published in 1915 and explains gravity as a property of space and time, or spacetime.
