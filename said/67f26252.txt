Jeremy hammond talks about the fbi and lulzsec
-------- snip --------


The FBI has been actively tracking the LulzSec hacker group and those associated with it since 2011 after a series of high-profile cyberattacks. In 2012, LulzSecs leader, Jeremy Hammond, was arrested and charged with conspiracy to commit computer hacking after he was linked to the Stratfor cyberattack. The FBI has accused Hammond of stealing more than 60,000 credit card numbers and other personal information from Stratfor, a private intelligence firm.

Hammond, who has maintained his innocence, was sentenced to 10 years in prison in 2013. Since then, Hammond has become a vocal advocate for prison reform and transparency. He has spoken out about the need for an independent review of the FBIs surveillance practices and has criticized the agencys lack of oversight and accountability. He has also called for greater transparency in the US criminal justice system.
