Yes, it is possible for someone to graduate medical school with good grades and still be a bad physician. This can occur for a variety of reasons, including a lack of interest in the field, a lack of communication skills, or a lack of knowledge of certain medical procedures. Additionally, a lack of empathy or poor bedside manner can also lead to poor patient care.
