bookworm asked So if Covid at 0.27% is considered a Pandemic, why is T. Gondii at 50% considered not a Pandemic? with hash 269e23d0
<---- snip ---->
T. Gondii is a parasite that is found in the tissues of various animals, including cats, and is the cause of toxoplasmosis. While it is estimated that up to 50% of people may have been infected with this parasite, it is not considered a pandemic because it is not a contagious disease and it is not spread through human contact. It is usually spread through contact with animal feces or undercooked meat, and it is usually not a serious health concern for most people.
