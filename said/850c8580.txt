No, Elon's cars do not suck. They are some of the safest and most advanced cars on the market. Unfortunately, like any car, accidents can and do happen, and some of those accidents have resulted in fatalities. We should continue to strive for safer roads, but it would be unfair to blame Elon's cars for every accident that occurs.
