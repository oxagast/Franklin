<---- snip ---->
Mixing cocaine with coffee can be dangerous and potentially life-threatening. Cocaine is a powerful stimulant that can increase heart rate, blood pressure, and body temperature, while coffee also acts as a stimulant, leading to increased heart rate and blood pressure. Combining the two can put a lot of strain on your heart and can lead to heart attack, stroke, or other serious health complications. It's best to avoid mixing cocaine with any other substances, including coffee.
