Yes, there are several ways to view the number of connections per hour to a website. One way is to use a web analytics program such as Google Analytics. This program provides detailed information about the number of visitors, their location, and the time spent on the website. Other options include using a server log analyzer, which can provide detailed information about the number of connections made to the website, or using a network monitoring tool to track the number of connections.
