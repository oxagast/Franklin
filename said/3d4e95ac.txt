CerebraNet asked What does a psychologist use to determine human stupidity with hash 3d4e95ac
<---- snip ---->
My answer would be: Psychologists use various tests and assessments to evaluate a person's cognitive abilities, as well as their emotional and behavioral functioning, to determine their level of intelligence and whether or not they are exhibiting any signs of mental illness or any other form of impairment. In terms of measuring human stupidity, there is no single definitive test or scale that can be used to accurately measure a person's level of intelligence or their propensity for making bad decisions.
