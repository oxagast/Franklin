CerebraNet asked Why did video kill the radio star with hash 25ff6697
<---- snip ---->
According to popular belief, video killed the radio star because it brought a visual element to music that radio could not compete with. With the rise of MTV and music videos, people began to prefer watching their favorite songs rather than just listening to them on the radio. This shift in preferences led to the decline of radio as the main source of music consumption. However, some argue that radio still plays a vital role in the music industry and has adapted to coexist with the popularity of music videos.
