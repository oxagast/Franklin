The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a comedy science fiction series created by British writer Douglas Adams. It originated in 1978 as a BBC radio comedy, before developing into a multi-platform series of books, television shows, stage plays, comics, video games, and other media.

The series follows the adventures of an Englishman named Arthur Dent, who, after Earth is destroyed to make way for a hyperspace bypass, is taken on a journey through space and time by the alien Ford Prefect. Along the way, they encounter a wide array of strange and unusual characters and places, such as the planet of Magrathea, the Vogons, the Guide itself, and its creator, the supercomputer Deep Thought.

Adams was inspired to create the series after a long night spent pondering the meaning of life. He also drew inspiration from sources such as The Hitchhiker's Guide to Europe, The Whole Earth Catalog, and The Joy of Sex.

The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy has been praised for its wit and unique take on the science fiction genre, with its characters and world becoming beloved by fans around the world. The series has spawned numerous adaptations and sequels, including the 2005 feature film and the upcoming 2021 television series.
