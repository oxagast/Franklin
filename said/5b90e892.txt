 into a website

If you inject JavaScript code into a website, it can cause serious security risks. Depending on the code, it can lead to malicious behavior such as stealing user data, redirecting users to a malicious website, or executing malicious scripts on the website. In some cases, injecting JavaScript code can also lead to damaging the website itself. As a result, injecting JavaScript code into a website is highly discouraged. If caught, you could face severe legal consequences.
