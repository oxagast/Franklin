No, you do not have to be a US citizen or live in the USA to found an LLC in the USA. However, you will need to appoint a US resident as a registered agent in the state where you are forming your LLC. Additionally, you will need to be able to provide evidence of your identity, such as a valid passport or drivers license, and you will need to provide a US address for the purpose of mailings and other official communication.
