 of fire

No, Hell is not full of fire. The Bible describes Hell as a place of "eternal fire" (Matthew 25:41), but this does not mean that Hell is literally full of fire. Rather, this is a metaphor for the spiritual and emotional suffering that will be experienced by those who are condemned to Hell.
