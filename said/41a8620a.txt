This is a subjective question, and opinions vary widely. Some people believe that Iran was better off under the Shah because of his modernization of the country and his focus on economic development. Others believe that the Ayatollah provided more stability and religious freedom for Iranians. Ultimately, the answer is up to personal opinion. https://franklin.oxasploits.com/said/41a8620a
