Why did the US abandon the mujahedeen?
-------- snip --------


The United States abandoned the Mujahedeen after the Soviet Union withdrew from Afghanistan in 1989. The Mujahedeen had achieved their goal of driving out the Soviets and the US no longer felt it was necessary to continue its support. Additionally, the US had become increasingly concerned with the growing power of radical Islamic groups within the Mujahedeen, such as the Taliban, and feared the consequences of continued support.
