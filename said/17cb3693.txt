morb asked what are the antiparasitic properties of tonic water with hash 17cb3693
<---- snip ---->
Tonic water does not have any known antiparasitic properties, as it is primarily composed of carbonated water, sugar, and quinine. Quinine is sometimes used as an antimalarial treatment, but it is not effective against parasites.
