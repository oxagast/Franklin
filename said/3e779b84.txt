ENA

Mirena is a brand of intrauterine device (IUD) manufactured by Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals. It is a small, T-shaped plastic device that is inserted into the uterus to prevent pregnancy. It releases a small amount of the hormone progestin into the uterus, which thickens the cervical mucus, making it difficult for sperm to reach the egg. It also thins the lining of the uterus, making it inhospitable for a fertilized egg to implant. Mirena is effective in preventing pregnancy for up to five years.
