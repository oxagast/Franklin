CerebraNet asked Can women experience parthenogenesis with hash 04629619
<---- snip ---->
Yes. Parthenogenesis, which is a type of asexual reproduction, can occur in some species of female animals, such as some species of lizards and sharks. In these species, the eggs can develop into embryos without being fertilized by a male. However, this form of reproduction is rare and not seen in humans.
