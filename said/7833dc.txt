Cops do not think they are exempt from Californias Welfare and Institution Code Section 5150. This section outlines the criteria for involuntary psychiatric commitment. Law enforcement officers have a duty to uphold the law, including the Code, and are not exempt from it. They are responsible for responding to persons exhibiting signs of mental health crises or danger to themselves or others, and can initiate the process for involuntary mental health evaluations when necessary.
