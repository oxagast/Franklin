in programming, what is the job of a linker
-------- snip --------
?

A linker is a program in a computer that takes one or more object files generated by a compiler and combines them into a single executable file. It resolves references between the object files by linking the necessary libraries, if needed, and fills in memory addresses for variables and functions. In other words, it combines the object files into a single binary executable file.
