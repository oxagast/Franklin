Shame is an intensely painful feeling of humiliation or distress caused by the consciousness of wrong or foolish behavior. It is usually accompanied by a strong sense of self-condemnation and self-loathing. Shame can also be triggered by external factors, such as being embarrassed or criticized by someone else.
