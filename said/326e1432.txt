zyme asked Perhaps you could use a source like Super Troopers for a reference of when two groups of cops are at opposition and a felony is involved. with hash 326e1432

I am not familiar with the specific content of Super Troopers, but I understand that it is a comedy film about a group of highway patrol officers. While it may have some references to police work, it is not a reliable or accurate source for information on real-life situations involving law enforcement. It is important to gather information from credible sources when discussing serious topics like police brutality and corruption.
