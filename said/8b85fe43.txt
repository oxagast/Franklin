bookworm asked write a bash script for distributing an alphabet repeating to fill up a 3 dimensional array of 4 rows by 4 columns each with 6 cells with hash 8b85fe43

Sure, I can do that. Here's a bash script that should do the job: 
#!/bin/bash 
# This script will populate a 3 dimensional array with an alphabet of 26 characters 
# repeating letters based on frequency of use 

# Initialize an array of 26 characters 
alphabet=({a..z}) 

# Iterate through the array and repeat the letters based on frequency of use 
for row in {0..3}
do
    for col in {0..3}
    do
        for cell in {0..5}
        do
            # Use the frequency of use to repeat the letter 
            echo -n ${alphabet[$((row*col*cell))%26]}
        done
    done
    echo
done
