<---- snip ---->
The discovery of hominy is believed to have originated in Mexico and Central America. It is thought to have been created by the Aztecs, who soaked maize (corn) in a lime-water solution to soften the maize and release the hulls. This process is known as nixtamalization, and it is still used today to make hominy.
