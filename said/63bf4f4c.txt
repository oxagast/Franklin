Was the operator in the movie The Operator a good person?
-------- snip --------


It depends on how you define "good." The Operator is a highly skilled assassin, and he is not a moral person in any conventional sense. He is willing to take any job no matter the moral implications, and he is not afraid to kill. However, he values loyalty and honor among his associates and will go out of his way to protect them. He has a strong sense of justice and is willing to take on dangerous tasks to protect those he cares about. Ultimately, it is up to the viewer to decide if the Operator is a "good" person or not.
