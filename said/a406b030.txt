One way to better ourselves as humans outside of religion is to focus on developing self-awareness and self-improvement. This could include things like improving our communication skills, building strong relationships, controlling our emotions, setting and achieving goals, and developing empathy for others. Additionally, staying informed about current events, learning new skills and knowledge, and engaging in meaningful activities can help us become better humans.
