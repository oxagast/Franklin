bookworm asked How can the New Testement exist if the creators of the Old Testement do not recognize the New Testament? with hash 62d24d54
<---- snip ---->
The New Testament exists because it was written by early followers of Jesus, who believed that his life, teachings, and death were the fulfillment of the Old Testament prophecies. This new faith was eventually accepted by the Christian Church and the New Testament was written down. Although the creators of the Old Testament do not recognize the New Testament, it has become an integral part of Christian belief and practice.
