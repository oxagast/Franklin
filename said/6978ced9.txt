<---- snip ---->
A Unitarian is a member of a religious movement that believes in the unity of God, the freedom of individuals to interpret religious teachings, and the importance of social justice and service. Unitarianism is founded on the belief that God is one, and that all people are related and of equal value. It is an open-minded, inclusive way of understanding the divine and living out a spiritual life.
