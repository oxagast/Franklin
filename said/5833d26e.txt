My cat does not like beef, is she ok.

Yes, cats can be picky eaters and it is perfectly normal for them to not like beef. If she is otherwise healthy, she should be fine. It is important to provide a balanced, nutritious diet for your cat, so if she doesnt like beef, make sure to substitute it with another protein source.
