<---- snip ---->
The percentage increases for genetic abnormalities in having a child incestuously are very high. It's estimated that the risk is around 50-100 times higher than for a non-incestuous union. This is due to the increased risk of genetic diseases and birth defects. It's important to note that this risk increases even further if the parents are closely related.
