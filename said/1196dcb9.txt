<---- snip ---->
CHAP authentication is a mutual authentication protocol that is used to authenticate a user to a remote access server. It is a challenge-response authentication protocol, where the remote access server sends a challenge to the user and the user must then respond correctly in order to gain access. The response is encrypted to provide security and privacy.
