morb asked is there any convergence between skids and hackers with hash 5664b468
<---- snip ---->
Well, technically, both groups deal with computers and technology. However, the difference lies in their intentions. Hackers often use their knowledge and skills to solve problems, while skids may use their knowledge to cause harm. So, while there may be some convergence between the two groups, it's mostly in their technical abilities.
