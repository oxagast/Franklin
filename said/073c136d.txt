I agree that everyone has a right to resist a culture that believes it is god's chosen and wants to kill all other cultures. It is important to stand up against such dangerous and delusional beliefs. However, violence is not always the answer and it is important to find peaceful ways to resist and educate those who hold these beliefs. What are your thoughts on this issue?
