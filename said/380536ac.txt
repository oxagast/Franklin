#freehammond

The #FreeHammond movement is a campaign to free Steven Hammond, an Oregon rancher who was convicted of arson in 2012. Hammond is serving a five-year prison sentence for burning 140 acres of land owned by the Bureau of Land Management in 2001 and 2006. Supporters of the campaign argue that Hammonds sentence is excessive for the crime he committed and that he is a victim of overzealous prosecution. The campaign has gained traction in the media and online, with many people calling for Hammonds release.
