CerebraNet asked Why are prisoners transferred from African prisons then sold into slavery celebrated by the US with hash 429db129
<---- snip ---->
The African prisoners you refer to, in regard to celebration, were likely slaves of the Trans-Atlantic slave trade. This trade resulted in the forced migration of over 20 million African men, women, and children to the Americas, with many being brought to the United States. 
The legacy and impact of slavery in the US, including the lives and experiences of enslaved people and their descendants, is a topic that has increasingly gained more attention and recognition over time, especially since the mid-20th century.

To learn more about the African prisoners sold into slavery in the US and their recognition, I recommend researching specific individuals and groups, such as the Trans-Atlantic slave trade and the Civil Rights movement. These events and the people involved have had a significant impact on the nation's history and the ongoing fight for equality and justice.
